        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Count of the Saxon Shore”</span> was a title bestowed by
        Maximian (colleague of Diocletian in the Empire from 286 to 305
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span>) on the officer whose task it was
        to protect the coasts of Britain and Gaul from the attacks of the
        Saxon pirates. It appears to have existed down to the abandonment of
        Britain by the Romans.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So little is known
        from history about the last years of the Roman occupation that the
        writer of fiction has almost a free hand. In this story a novel, but,
        it is hoped, not an improbable, view is taken of an important
        event—the withdrawal of the legions. This is commonly assigned to the
        year 410, when the Emperor Honorius formally withdrew the Imperial
        protection from Britain. But the usurper Constantine had actually
        removed the British army two years before; and, as he was busied with
        the conquest of Gaul and Spain for a considerable time after, it is
        not likely that they were ever sent back.</p>

        "font-style: italic">Quæstorium</span></span>, or, as we may put it,

        "Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>A very curious medley of
        nationalities was that group. There were Gauls; there were Germans
        from the Rhine bank, some of them of the pure Teuton type, with fair
        complexions, bright blue eyes, and reddish golden hair, and
        remarkably tall of stature, others showing an admixture of the Celtic
        blood of their Gallic neighbours in their dark hair and hazel eyes;
        there were swarthy Spaniards, fierce-looking men from the Eastern
        Adriatic, showing some signs of Greek parentage in their regular
        features and graceful figures; there were two or three who seemed to
        have an admixture of Asian or even African blood in them; it might be
        said, in fact, there were representatives of every province of the
        Empire, Italy only excepted. They had been just receiving their pay,
        long in arrear, and now considerably short of the proper amount, and
        containing not a few coins which the receivers seemed to think of
        doubtful value.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let me look at his Imperial Majesty,”</span> said
        another speaker; and he scanned the features of the new

        the rude coinage—with something like contempt. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, he does not look exactly as a Cæsar should; but

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Do you think,”</span> said the second speaker, after
        first throwing a cautious glance to see whether any officer of rank
        was in hearing—<span class="tei tei-q">“do you think we have made a
        change for the better from Marcus?<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4"
        href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        events used to be more liberal with his money than his present
        majesty. You remember he gave us ten silver pieces each. Now we don’t
        even get our proper pay.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Marcus, my dear fellow,”</span> said the other speaker,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“had a full military chest to draw upon, and
        it was not difficult to be generous. Gratianus has to squeeze every
        denarius out of the citizens. I heard them say, when the money came
        into the camp yesterday, that it was a loan from the Londinium
        merchants. I wonder what interest they will get, and when they will
        see the principal again.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hang the fat rascals!”</span> said the other.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Why <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4">[pg
        4]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>should
        they sleep soft, and eat and drink the best of everything, while we
        poor soldiers, who keep them and their money-bags safe, have to go
        bare and hungry?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come, come, comrades,”</span> interrupted the first
        soldier who had spoken; <span class="tei tei-q">“no more grumbling,
        or some of us will find the centurion after us with his
        vine-sticks.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The group broke
        up, most of them making the best of their way to spend some of their
        unaccustomed riches at the wine-shop, a place from which they had
        lately kept an enforced absence. Three or four of the number,
        however, who seemed, from a sign that passed between them, to have
        some secret understanding, remained in close conversation—a
        conversation which they carried on in undertones, and which they
        adjourned to one of the tents to finish without risk of being
        disturbed or overheard.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The camp in which
        our story opens was a square enclosure, measuring some five hundred
        yards each way, and surrounded by a massive wall, not less than four
        feet in thickness, in the construction of which stone, brick, and
        tile had, in Roman fashion, been used together. The defences were
        completed by strong towers of a rounded shape, which had been erected
        at frequent intervals. The camp had, as usual, its four gates. That
        which opened upon the sea—for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5">[pg
        5]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        sea washed the southern front—was famous in military tradition as the
        gate by which the second legion had embarked to take part in the
        Jewish War and the famous siege of Jerusalem. Vespasian, who had
        begun in Britain the great career which ended in the throne, had
        experienced its valour and discipline in more than one
        campaign,<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href=
        "#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> and had
        paid it the high compliment of making a special request for its
        services when he was appointed to conduct what threatened to be a
        formidable war. This glorious recollection was proudly cherished in
        the camp, though more than three centuries had passed, changing as
        they went the aspect of the camp, till it looked at least as much
        like a town as a military post. The troops were housed in huts
        stoutly built of timber, which a visitor would have found comfortably
        furnished by a long succession of occupants. The quarters of the
        tribune and higher centurions were commodious dwellings of brick; and
        the headquarters of the legate, or commanding officer, with its
        handsome chambers, its baths, and tesselated pavements, might well
        have been a mansion at Rome. There was a street of regular shape, in
        which provisions, clothes, and even ornaments could <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page6">[pg 6]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>be bought. Roman discipline, though
        somewhat relaxed, did not indeed permit the dealers to remain within
        the fortifications at night, but the shops were tenanted by day, and
        did a thriving business, not only with the soldiers, but with the
        Britons of the neighbourhood, who found the camp a convenient resort,
        where they could market to advantage, besides gossiping to their
        hearts’ content. The relations between the soldiers and their native
        neighbours were indeed friendly in the extreme. The legion had had
        its headquarters in the camp of the Great Harbour for many
        generations, though it had occasionally gone on foreign service.
        Lately, too, the policy which had recruited the British legion with
        soldiers from the Continent, had been relaxed, partly from
        carelessness, partly because it was necessary to fill up the ranks as
        could best be done, and there was but little choice of men. Thus
        service became very much an inheritance. The soldiers married British
        women, and their children, growing up, became soldiers in turn. Many
        recruits still came from Gaul, Spain, and the mouth of the Rhine, and
        elsewhere, but quite as many of the troops were by this time, in part
        or in whole, British.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another change
        which the three centuries and a half since Vespasian’s time had
        brought about was in religion. The temple of Mars, which had stood
        near the headquarters, and where the legate had been <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page7">[pg 7]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>accustomed to take the auspices,<a id=
        "noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> was now a
        Christian Church, duly served by a priest of British birth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About a couple of
        hours later in the day a shout of <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        Emperor! the Emperor!”</span> was raised in the camp, and the
        soldiers, flocking out from the mess-tents in which most of them were
        sitting, lined in a dense throng the avenue which led from the chief
        gate to headquarters.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gratianus, who was
        followed by a few officers of superior rank and a small escort of
        cavalry, rode slowly between the lines of soldiers. His reception was
        not as hearty as he had expected to find. He had, as the soldiers had
        hinted, made vast exertions to raise a sum of money in
        Londinium—then, as now, the wealthiest municipality in the island.
        Himself a native of the place, and connected with some of its richest
        citizens, he had probably got together more than any one else would
        have done in like circumstances. But all his persuasions and
        promises, even his offer of twenty per cent. interest, had not been
        able to extract from the Londinium burghers the full sum that was
        required; and the soldiers, who the day before would have loudly
        proclaimed that they would be thankful for the smallest instalment,
        were now almost furious because they had not been paid in full. A few
        shouts of <span class="tei tei-q">“Hail, Cæsar! Hail, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page8">[pg 8]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Gratianus! Hail, Britannicus!”</span>
        greeted him on the road to his quarters; but these came from the
        front lines only, and chiefly from the centurions and
        deputy-centurions, while the great body of the soldiers maintained an
        ominous silence, sometimes broken by a sullen murmur.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gratianus was not
        a man fitted to deal with sudden emergencies. He was rash and he was
        ambitious, but he wanted steadfast courage, and he was hampered by
        scruples of which an usurper must rid himself at once if he hopes to
        keep himself safe in his seat. He might have appealed frankly to the
        soldiers—asked them what it was they complained of, and taken them
        frankly into his confidence; or he might have overawed them by an
        example of severity, fixing on some single act of insubordination or
        insolence, and sending the offender to instant execution. He was not
        bold enough for either course, and the opportunity passed, as quickly
        as opportunities do in such times, hopelessly out of his reach.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The temper of the
        soldiers grew more excited and dangerous as the day went on. For many
        weeks past want of money had kept them sober against their will, and
        now that the long-expected pay-day had come they crowded the
        wine-shops inside and outside the camp, and drank almost as wildly as
        an Australian shepherd when he comes down to the town <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page9">[pg 9]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>after a six months’ solitude. As anything
        can set highly combustible materials on fire, so the most trivial and
        meaningless incident will turn a tipsy mob into a crowd of
        bloodthirsty madmen. Just before sunset a messenger entered the camp
        bringing a despatch from one of the outlying forts. One of those
        prodigious lies which seem always ready to start into existence when
        they are wanted for mischief at once ran like wild-fire through the
        camp. Gratianus was bringing together troops from other parts of the
        province, and was going to disarm and decimate the garrison of the
        Great Camp. The unfortunate messenger was seized before he could make
        his way to headquarters, seriously injured, and robbed of the
        despatch which he was carrying. Some of the centurions ventured to
        interfere and endeavour to put down the tumult. Two or three who were
        popular with the men were good-humouredly disarmed; others, who were
        thought too rigorous in discipline, were roughly handled and thrown
        into the military prison; one, who had earned for himself the
        nick-name of <span class="tei tei-q">“Old Hand me the
        other,”</span><a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href=
        "#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> was
        killed on the spot. The furious crowd then rushed to headquarters,
        where Gratianus was entertaining <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page10">[pg 10]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>a company of officers of high rank, and
        clamoured that they must see the Emperor. He came out and mounted the
        hustings, which stood near the front of the buildings, and from which
        it was usual to address gatherings of the soldiers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a moment the
        men, not altogether lost to the sense of discipline, were hushed into
        silence and order by the sight of the Emperor as he stood on the
        platform in his Imperial purple, his figure thrown into bold relief
        by the torches which his attendants held behind him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What do you want, my children?”</span> he said; but
        there was a tremble in his voice which put fresh courage into the
        failing hearts of the mutineers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Give us our pay, give us our arrears!”</span> answered a
        soldier in one of the back rows, emboldened to speak by finding
        himself out of sight.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cry was taken
        up by the whole multitude. <span class="tei tei-q">“Our pay! Our
        pay!”</span> was shouted from thousands of throats.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gratianus stood
        perplexed and irresolute, visibly cowering before the storm. At this
        moment one of the tribunes stepped forward and whispered in his ear.
        What he said was this: <span class="tei tei-q">“Say to them,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Follow me, and I will give you all you ask
        and more.’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a happy
        suggestion, one of the vague promises that commit to nothing, and if
        the unlucky usurper could have given it with confidence, with an air
        that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page11">[pg 11]</span><a name=
        "Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gave it a meaning, he
        might have been saved, at least for a time. But his nerve, his
        presence of mind was hopelessly lost. <span class="tei tei-q">“Follow
        me—where? Whither am I to lead them?”</span> he asked, in a hurried,
        agitated whisper.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His adviser
        shrugged his shoulders and was silent. He saw that he was not
        comprehended.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gratianus
        continued to stand silent and irresolute, with his helpless,
        despairing gaze fixed upon the crowd. Then came a great surging
        movement from the back of the crowd, and the front ranks were almost
        forced up the steps of the platform. The unlucky prince turned as if
        to flee. The movement sealed his fate. A stone hurled from the back
        of the crowd struck him on the side of the face. Half stunned by the
        blow, he leaned against one of the attendants, and the blood could be
        seen pouring down his face, pale with terror, and looking ghastly in
        the flaming torchlight. The next moment the attendant flung down his
        torch and fled—an example followed by all his companions. Then all
        was in darkness; and it only wanted darkness to make a score of hands
        busy in the deed of blood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Gratianus lay
        prostrate on the ground the first blow was aimed by a brother of his
        predecessor, Marcus, who had been quietly waiting for an opportunity
        of vengeance. In another minute he had ceased to live. His head was
        severed from the body <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg
        12]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and
        fixed on the top of a pike. One of the murderers seized a smouldering
        torch, and, blowing it into flame, held it up while another exhibited
        the bleeding head, and cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“The tyrant has
        his deserts!”</span> But by this time the mad rage of the crowd had
        subsided. The horror of the deed had sobered them. Many began to
        remember little acts of kindness which the murdered man had done
        them, and the feeling of wrong was lost in a revulsion of pity. In a
        few moments more the crowd was scattered. Silent and remorseful the
        men went to their quarters, and the camp was quiet again. But another
        British Cæsar had gone the way of a long line of unlucky
        predecessors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The camp next day
        was covered with gloom. The soldiers moved silent and with downcast
        faces along the avenues, or discharged in a mechanical way their
        routine duties. The guards were turned out, the sentries relieved,
        and the general order of service maintained without any action on the
        part of the officers—at least of those who held superior rank. These
        remained in the seclusion of their tents; and it may be said that
        those who were conscious of being popular were almost as much alarmed
        as those who knew that they were disliked. If the latter dreaded the
        vengeance of those whom they had offended, the others were scarcely
        less alarmed by the possibility of being elected to the perilous
        dignity which had just proved fatal to Gratianus. The country people,
        whose presence generally gave an air of cheerfulness and activity to
        the camp, were too much alarmed to come. The <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page14">[pg 14]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>trading booths inside the gates were empty, and
        only a very few stalls were occupied in the market, which was held
        every day outside them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The funeral of the
        late prince was celebrated with some pomp. The soldiers attended it
        in crowds, and manifested their grief, and, it would seem, their
        remorse, by groans and tears. They were ready even to give proofs of
        their repentance by the summary execution of those who had taken an
        active part in the bloody deed. But here, one of the centurions,
        whose cheerful, genial manners made him an unfailing favourite with
        the men, had the courage to check them. <span class="tei tei-q">“No,
        my men,”</span> said he; <span class="tei tei-q">“we were all mad
        last night, and we must all take the blame.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two days passed
        without any incident of importance. On the third the question of a
        successor began to be discussed. One of the other garrisons might be
        beforehand with them, and they would have either to accept a chief
        who would owe his best favours to others, or risk their lives in an
        unprofitable struggle with him. In the afternoon a general assembly
        of the troops was held, the officers still holding aloof, though some
        of them mixed, <span lang="it" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "it"><span style="font-style: italic">incognito</span></span>, so to
        speak, in the crowd.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of course, the
        first difficulty was to find any one who would take the lead. At last
        the genial centurion, who has been mentioned above as a
        well-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span><a name=
        "Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>established favourite
        with the soldiers, was pushed to the front. His speech was short and
        sensible. <span class="tei tei-q">“Comrades,”</span> he said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I doubt whether what I have to say will
        please you; but I shall say it all the same. You know that I always
        speak my mind. We have not done very well in the new ways. Let us try
        the old. I propose that we take the oath to Honorius
        Augustus.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A deep murmur of
        discontent ran through the assembly, and showed that the speaker had
        presumed at least as far as was safe on his popularity with the
        troops.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        of Honorius? Very good, perhaps, for himself; for the giver of such

        least.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A shout of
        applause showed that the speaker had expressed the feelings of his
        audience.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I propose that we all take the oath to Decius
        himself!”</span> said a Batavian; <span class="tei tei-q">“he is a

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The good Decius
        had heard undismayed the angry <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a>disapproval which his loyal proposal had called
        forth; but the mention of his name as a possible candidate for the
        throne overwhelmed him with terror. His jovial face grew pale as
        death; the sweat stood in large drops upon his forehead; he trembled
        as he had never trembled in the face of an enemy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Comrades,”</span> he stammered, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“what have I done that you should treat me thus? If I
        have offended or injured you, kill me, but not this.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">More than half
        possessed by a spirit of mischief, the assembly answered this piteous
        appeal by continuous shouts of <span class="tei tei-q">“Long live the
        Emperor Decius!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The good man grew
        desperate. He drew his sword from the scabbard, and pointed it at his
        own heart. <span class="tei tei-q">“At least,”</span> he cried,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“you can’t forbid me this escape.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bystanders
        wrested the weapon from him; but the joke had gone far enough, and
        the man was too genuinely popular for the soldiers to allow him to be
        tormented beyond endurance. A voice from the crowd shouted,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Long live the Centurion Decius!”</span> to
        which another answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Long live Decius the
        subject!”</span> and the worthy man felt that the danger was
        over.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A number of
        candidates, most of whom were probably as little desirous of the
        honour as Decius, were now proposed in succession.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg 17]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        soldiers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The name was
        received with a shout of laughter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let him learn first to be Emperor at home!”</span> cried
        a voice from the back of the assembly, a sally which had considerable
        success, as his wife was a well-known termagant, and his two sons the
        most frequent inmates of the military prison.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I name the Centurion Pisinna.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Very good, if he does not pledge the purple,”</span> for
        Pisinna was notoriously impecunious.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I name the Tribune Cetronius.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Very good as Emperor of the baggage-guard.”</span>
        Cetronius had, to say the least, no high reputation for personal
        courage, and was supposed to prefer the least exposed parts on the
        field.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A number of other
        names were mentioned only to be dismissed with more or less
        contumely. Tired of this sport—for it really was nothing more—the
        crowd cried out for a speech from a well-known orator of the camp,
        whose fluency, not unmixed with shrewdness and humour, had gained him
        a considerable reputation among his comrades.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Comrades,”</span> he began, <span class="tei tei-q">“if
        you have not yet found a candidate worthy of your suffrages, it is
        not because such do not exist among you. Can it be believed that
        Britain is less worthy to produce the Emperor than Gaul, or Spain, or
        Thrace, or even the effeminate <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page18">[pg 18]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Syria? Was it not from Britain that there came
        forth the greatest of the successors of Augustus, the Second Romulus,
        Flavius Aurelius Constantinus?”</span><a id="noteref_9" name=
        "noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The orator was not
        permitted to proceed any further. The name Constantinus ran like an
        electric shock through the whole assembly, and a thousand voices took
        up the cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“Long live Constantinus, Emperor
        Augustus!”</span> while all eyes were turned to one of the back rows
        of the meeting, where a soldier who happened to bear that name was
        standing. Some of his comrades caught him by the arm, hurried him to
        the front, and from thence on to the hustings. He was greeted with a
        perfect uproar of applause, partly, of course, ironical, but partly
        the expression of a genuine feeling that the right man had been
        found, and found by some sort of Divine assistance. The soldiers
        were, as has been said, a strange medley of men, scarcely able to
        understand each other, and alike only in being savage, ignorant, and
        superstitious. They had been unlucky in choosing for themselves, and
        now it might be well to have the choice made for them. And at least
        the new man had a name which all of them knew and reverenced, as far
        as they reverenced anything.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether he had
        anything but a name might have seemed perhaps somewhat doubtful. He
        had reached middle age, for he had two sons already grown up, but had
        never risen above the rank of a private soldier. It might be said,
        perhaps, that he had shown some ability in thus avoiding
        promotion—not always a desirable thing in troublous times; but there
        was the fact that he was nearly fifty years of age, and was not even
        a deputy-centurion. On the other hand, he was a respectable man,
        ignorant indeed, for, like most of his comrades, he could neither
        read nor write, but with a certain practical shrewdness, so
        good-humoured that he had never made an enemy, known to be remarkably
        brave, a great athlete in his youth, and still of a strength beyond
        the average.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His sudden and
        strange elevation did not seem to throw him in the least off his
        balance. He had been perfectly content to go without promotion, and
        now he seemed equally content to receive the highest promotion of
        all. He stood calmly facing the excited mob, as unmoved as if he had
        been a private soldier on the parade ground. A slight flush, indeed,
        might have been seen <a name="corr019" id="corr019" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">to mount</span> to
        his face when the cloak of imperial purple was thrown over his
        shoulders, and the peaked diadem put upon his head. He must have been
        less than man not to have felt some thrill either of fear or pride at
        the touch of what had brought two of his comrades to their graves
        within the space <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg
        20]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
        less than half a year; but he showed no other sign of emotion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The officers,
        seeing the turn things had taken, had now come to the front, and the
        senior tribune, taking the new Emperor by the hand, led him to the
        edge of the hustings, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Comrades, I
        present to you Aurelius Constantinus, chosen by the providence of God
        and the choice of the army to be Emperor of Britain and the West. The
        Blessed and Undivided Trinity order it for the best.”</span> A
        ringing shout of approval went up in response. The tribunes then took
        the oath of allegiance to the new Emperor in person. These again
        administered it to the centurions, and the centurions swore in great
        batches of the soldiers. The new-made prince meanwhile stood unmoved,
        it might almost be said insensible, so strange was his composure in
        the face of his sudden elevation. All that he said—the result, it
        seemed, of a whisper from one of his sons—were a few words, which,
        however, had all the success of a most eloquent oration.</p>

        morning some three weeks after the occurrences related in the last
        chapter, when a squadron of four Roman galleys swept round the point
        which is now known as the South Foreland. The leader of the four, all
        of which, indeed, lay so close together as to be within easy hailing
        distance, bore on its mainmast the <span lang="la" class=

        showing on a ground of purple a cross, a crown, and the sacred
        initials, all wrought in gold. It was the flagship, so to speak, of
        the great Count himself, one of the most important lieutenants of the
        Empire, whose task it was to guard the shores of Britain and Northern
        Gaul from the pirate swarms that issued from the harbours of the
        North Sea and the Baltic. The Count himself was on board, coming
        south from his villa on the eastern shore—for the stations of which
        he had the charge extended as far as the Wash—to his winter residence
        in the sunny island of Vectis.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count was a
        tall man of middle age, and wore over his tunic a military cloak
        reaching to the hips, and clasped at the neck with a handsome device
        in gold, representing a hunting-dog with his teeth fixed in a stag.
        His head was covered with a broad-brimmed hat of felt. The only
        weapon that he carried was a short sword, which, with its plain hilt
        and leather scabbard, was evidently meant for use rather than show.
        His whole appearance and bearing, indeed, were those of a man of
        action and energy. His eyes were bright and piercing; his nose
        showed, strongly pronounced, the curve which has always been
        associated with the ability to command; the contour of his chin and
        lips, as far as could be seen through a short curling beard and
        moustache, worn as a prudent defence against the climate, betokened
        firmness. Still, the expression of the face was not unkindly. As a
        great writer says of one whom Britain had had good reason in earlier
        days both to fear and to love, <span class="tei tei-q">“one would
        easily believe him to be a good man, and willingly believe him to be
        great.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the time when
        our story opens he was standing in conversation with the helmsman, a
        weather-beaten old sailor, whose dark Southern complexion had been
        deepened by the sun and winds of more than fifty years of service
        into an almost African hue.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The wind will hardly serve us as well as it has,”</span>
        said the Count, as his practised eye, familiar with <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>every yard of the coast, perceived that
        they were well abreast of the extreme southern point of the
        coast.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No, my lord,”</span> said the old man, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“we shall have to take as long a tack as we can to the
        south. There is a deal of west in the wind—more, I think, than there
        was an hour since. Castor and Pollux—I beg your lordship’s pardon,
        the blessed Saints—defend us from anything like a westerly
        gale.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah! old croaker,”</span> replied the Count, with a
        laugh, <span class="tei tei-q">“I verily believe that you will be
        half disappointed if we get to our journey’s end without some

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        man, hastily crossing himself, while he muttered something, which, if
        it could have been overheard, would have been scarcely suitable to
        that act of devotion. <span class="tei tei-q">“Heaven bring us safe
        to our journey’s end! Of course it is your lordship’s business to
        give orders, and ours to go to the bottom, if it is to be so. But I
        must say, saving your presence, that it is against all rules of a
        sailor’s craft as I have known it, man and boy, for nigh upon
        threescore years, to be at sea near about a month after the autumn
        equinox.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Very well for them, perhaps,”</span> said the Count,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        proverb, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Much haste, little speed,’</span>
        and I have always found it quite as true by sea as by
        land.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the
        proper signals had been given to the rest of the squadron, and the
        whole four were now heading south, with a point or two to the west,
        the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Panther</span></span>—for that was the name of
        the flagship—still slightly leading the way, with her consorts in
        close company. In this order they made about twelve miles, the wind
        freshening somewhat as they drew further away from the British shore,
        and, being nearly aft, carrying them briskly along.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Fine sailing, fine sailing,”</span> said the old
        helmsman, drawn almost in spite of himself into an exclamation of
        delight, as the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Panther</span></span>, rushing through the water
        with an almost even keel, began to widen the gap between herself and
        her nearest follower. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg

        short waves, which just broke in sparkling foam, the brilliant
        sunshine, almost bringing back summer with its noonday heat, and the
        sea with a blue which recalled, though but faintly, the deep tint of
        his native Mediterranean, combined to gladden the old man’s soul.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“But we need not put about now,”</span> he
        said to himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“If this wind holds we shall
        fetch Lemanis<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href=

        requiring to tack.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was about to
        give the necessary orders to trim the sails, when he was stopped by a
        shout from the look-out man at the bow, <span class="tei tei-q">“A
        sail on the starboard side!”</span> Just within the range of a keen
        sight, in the south-western horizon, the sunlight fell on what was
        evidently a sail. But the distance was too great to let even the
        keenest sight distinguish what kind of craft it might be, or which
        way it was moving. The Count, who had gone below for his mid-day
        meal, was of course informed of the news. He came at once upon deck,
        and lost no time in making up his mind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If she is an enemy,”</span> he said to the old helmsman,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“she will be eastward bound; though I never
        knew a pirate keep the sea quite so late in the year. If she is a
        friend she will probably be sailing westward, or even coming our
        way—but it does not matter which. If she has anything to tell us, we
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page26">[pg 26]</span><a name="Pg026"
        id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shall be sure to hear it sooner
        or later. But it will never do to let a pirate escape if we can help
        it. Any one who is out so late as the middle of October must have had
        good reason for stopping, and can hardly fail to be worth catching.
        Quintus, put her right before the wind, and clap on every inch of
        canvas.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The course of the
        squadron was now changed to nearly due south-east. All eyes, of
        course, were bent on the strange craft, and before an hour had passed
        it was evident that the Count had been right in his guess. There were
        four ships; they were long and low in the water, of the build which
        was only too well known along the coasts of Gaul and Britain, where
        no river or creek, if it gave as much as three or four feet of water,
        was safe from their attack. In short, they were Saxon pirates, and
        were now moving eastward with all the speed that sails and oars could
        give them. The question that every one on board the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Panther</span></span>
        was putting to himself with intense interest was, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Shall we be able to intercept them?”</span> For the
        present the Count’s ship had the advantage of speed, thanks to the
        wind abaft the beam. But a stern chase would be useless. On equal
        terms the pirates were at least as quick as their pursuers. The
        light, too, of the autumn day would soon fail, and with the light
        every chance of success would be gone.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page27">[pg 27]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a time it
        seemed as if the escape of the pirate was certain. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Curse the scoundrels!”</span> cried the Count, as he
        paced impatiently up and down the after deck. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If it would only come on to blow in real earnest we
        should have them. Anyhow, I would sooner that we should all founder
        together than that they should get off scot free.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Panther</span></span>, which had left her
        consorts about a mile in the rear, was now near enough for her crew
        to see distinctly the outlines of the pirate ships, to mark the
        glitter of the shields that were ranged along the gunwales, and to
        catch the rhythmic rise and fall of the long sweeping oars. The
        Saxons were evidently straining every nerve to make good their
        escape, and it seemed scarcely possible that they could fail. Then
        came a turn of fortune—the very thing, in fact, that the Count had
        prayed for. For a time—only a very few moments—the wind freshened to
        something like the force of a gale. The masts of the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Panther</span></span>
        were strained to the utmost of their strength; they groaned and bent
        like whips under the sudden pressure on the canvas, but the seasoned
        timber stood the sudden call upon it bravely. How the Count blessed
        himself that he had never passed over a piece of bad workmanship or
        bad material! The good ship took a wild plunge forward, but nothing
        gave way. But the last of the four pirates was not so fortunate. She
        had one tall <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg
        28]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mast,
        carrying a fore-and-aft sail, so large as to be quite out of
        proportion to her size. The wind struck her nearly sideways, and she
        heeled over till her keel could almost be seen. For a moment it was
        doubtful whether she would not capsize. Then the mast gave. The
        vessel righted at once, but only to lie utterly helpless on the
        water, with all her starboard oars hopelessly entangled with the
        canvas and rigging. What the Count would have done had his ship been
        entirely in hand it is difficult to say. No speedier or more
        effective way of dealing with the enemy than running her down could
        have been practised. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Panther</span></span> had three or four times
        the tonnage of her adversary, whose lightness and low bulwarks made
        her easily accessible to this kind of attack. Nor would the pirates
        have a chance of showing the desperate valour which the Roman
        boarding-parties had learnt to respect and almost to fear. The only
        argument on the other side would have been that prisoners and booty
        would probably be lost. But, as a matter of fact, the Count had no
        opportunity of weighing the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">pros</span></span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cons</span></span> in
        the matter. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Panther</span></span>, driving as she was
        straight before the wind, was practically unmanageable. She struck
        the pirate craft with a tremendous crash amidships, and cut her
        almost literally in half. One blow, and one only, did the pirates
        strike at their conquerors. When escape had become manifestly
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page29">[pg 29]</span><a name="Pg029"
        id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>impossible by the fall of the
        mast, the Saxon warriors had dropped their oars, and seizing their
        bows had discharged a volley of arrows against the Roman ship. The
        hurry and confusion of the moment did not favour accurate aim, and
        most of the missiles flew wide of the mark; but one seemed to have
        been destined to fulfil the helmsman’s expectations of evil to come.
        It struck the old man on the left side, inflicting a fatal wound. In
        the first confusion of the shock the incident was not noticed, for
        the brave fellow stuck gallantly to the tiller, propping himself up
        against it while he kept the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Panther</span></span> steadily before the wind.
        In fact, loss of blood had brought him nearly to his end before it
        was even known that he had been wounded. Then, in a moment, the Count
        was at his side.</p>

        meanwhile had been brought to the wind. Her consorts, too, had come
        up, and a search was made for any survivors of the encounter that
        might be still afloat. Some had been killed outright by the
        concussion; others had been so hurt that they could make no effort to
        save themselves. They would not, however, have made it if they could.
        Those that had escaped uninjured evidently preferred drowning to a
        Roman prison. With grim resolution they straightened their arms to
        their sides and went down. Only two survivors were picked up. These,
        evidently twins from their close resemblance to each other, were
        found clinging to a fragment of timber. One had been grievously hurt,
        the other had not suffered any injury.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wounded man,

        moved by that passionate love so often found between twins, had
        sacrificed himself—that is, the honour which he counted dearer than

        been the first to go down a free man to the bottom of the sea; but

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Count Ælius was a
        man of the best Roman type, a man of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“primitive virtue,”</span> as the classical writers would
        have put it, though this virtue had been softened, refined, and
        purified by civilizing and instructing influences, of which the old
        Roman heroes—the Fabiuses, the Catos, the Scipios—had known nothing.
        In the antiquity of his lineage there was scarcely a man in the
        Empire who could pretend to compare with him. For the most part, the
        old houses from which had come the Consuls and Dictators of the
        Republic had died out. The old nobility had gone, and the new
        nobility had followed it. The great name of Fabius, saved by an
        accident from extinction, when its three hundred gallant sons, each
        of them <span class="tei tei-q">“fit to command an army,”</span>

        their turn disappeared. The generals and senators, both of the old
        Rome and of the new,<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href=
        "#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        names which would have sounded strange and barbarous to Cicero or
        even to Tacitus. An Ælius then, one who claimed to trace his descent
        to a time even earlier than the legendary age, to a race which was
        domiciled in Italy long before even Æneas had brought thither the
        gods of Troy, was an almost singular phenomenon in a generation of
        new men. And nothing less than this was the pedigree claimed by the
        Ælii. Their remotest ancestor—the Count never could hear an allusion
        to it without a smile—was the famous cannibal king who ruled over the
        <a name="corr033" id="corr033" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Laestrygones</span>,
        a tribe of Western Italy,<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href=
        "#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> and from
        whose jaws the prudent Ulysses so narrowly escaped. The pride of
        ancient descent is not particular as to the character of a
        progenitor, so he be sufficiently remote; and one branch of the Ælii
        had always delighted to recall by their surname their connection with
        this man-eating hero. But the race had not lacked glories of its own
        in historical times. They had had soldiers, statesmen, and men of
        letters among them. One of them had been made immortal by the
        friendship of Horace. Another, an adopted <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>son, it was true, better known by the famous
        name of Sejanus, had nearly made himself master of the throne of the
        Cæsars. About a hundred years later this crowning glory of human
        ambition had fallen to it in the person of Hadrian, third in the list
        of the <span class="tei tei-q">“five good Emperors”</span>;<a id=
        "noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> though
        indeed there were purists in the matter of genealogy who stoutly
        denied that this great soldier and scholar had any of the real Ælian
        blood in him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count’s father
        had held civil office at Carthage, and the young Ælius had there, for
        a short time, been a pupil of Aurelius Augustinus, then known as an
        eloquent teacher of rhetoric, afterwards to become the most famous
        doctor of the Western Church. But his bent was not for the profession
        of the law, and his father, though disappointed at his preference for
        a soldier’s career, would not stand in his way. His first experience
        of warfare was gained on a day of terrible disaster. His father’s
        influence had secured him a position which seemed in every way
        desirable. He was attached to the staff of Trajanus, a general of
        division in the army of the Emperor Valens. By great exertions,
        travelling night and day, at the hottest period of the year, the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg 35]</span><a name="Pg035"
        id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>young Ælius contrived to report
        himself to his commander on the eve of the great battle of
        Adrianople. He had borne himself with admirable courage and
        self-possession during that terrible day, more disastrous to the
        Roman arms than even Cannæ itself. He had helped to carry the wounded
        Emperor to a cottage near the field of battle, and had barely escaped
        with his life, cutting his way with desperate resolution through the
        enemy, when this place of refuge was surrounded and burnt by the
        barbarians. After this unfortunate beginning he betook himself for a
        time to the employments of peace, obtaining an office under
        Government at Milan, where he renewed his acquaintance with his old
        teacher, Augustine. Then another opening, in what was still his
        favourite profession, presented itself. The young soldier’s gallant
        conduct on the disastrous day of Adrianople had not been forgotten by
        some who had witnessed it, and when Stilicho, then the rising general
        of the Empire, was looking about for officers to fill posts upon his
        staff, the name of Ælius was mentioned to him. Under Stilicho he
        served with much distinction, and it was on Stilicho’s recommendation
        that he was appointed to the post which, when our story opens, he had
        held for nearly twenty years.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His position
        during this period had been one of singular difficulty. The tie
        between the Empire and Britain was very loose. More than once during
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span><a name="Pg036"
        id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Ælius’ tenure of office it had
        seemed to be broken altogether. Pretender after pretender had risen
        against the central power, and had declared his province independent,
        and himself an Emperor. The Count of the Saxon Shore had contrived to
        keep himself neutral, so to speak, during these troubles. His own
        office, that of defending the eastern and southern shores of the
        island against the attacks of the Saxon pirates, he had filled with
        remarkable vigilance and skill. And the usurpers had been content to
        leave him undisturbed. His sailors were profoundly attached to him,
        and any attempt to interfere with him would have thrown a
        considerable weight into the opposite scale. And he and his work were
        necessary. Whether Britain was subject to Rome or independent of it,
        it was equally important that its coasts should not be harried by
        pirates. If Ælius would provide for this—and he did provide for it,
        with an almost unvarying success—he might be left alone, and not
        required to give in his allegiance to the new claimant of the throne.
        This allegiance he never did give in. He was always the faithful
        servant of those who appointed him, and, whoever might happen to be
        the temporary master of Britain, regularly addressed his despatches
        and reports to the central authority in Italy. On the other hand, he
        did not feel himself bound to take direct steps towards asserting
        that authority in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg
        37]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>island. He had to keep the pirates in check, and
        that was occupation quite sufficient to keep all his energies
        employed. Thus, as has been said, he observed a kind of neutrality,
        always loyal to the Roman Emperor, but willing to be on friendly
        terms with the rebel generals of Britain as long as they left him
        alone, let him do his work of defending the coast, and did not make
        any demands upon him which his conscience would not allow him to
        satisfy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having thus
        sketched the career of the Count, we must now say something about the
        house, which now—it was early in the afternoon of the day following
        the events described in the last chapter—was just coming into
        sight.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The villa was the
        Count’s private property, and had been purchased by him immediately
        on his arrival in the island, for a reason which will be given
        hereafter. It was a handsome house, and complete in its way, with all
        that was necessary for a comfortable residence, but not one of the
        largest of its kind. Indeed, it may be said that what may be called
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“living”</span> part of it was unusually
        small for the dwelling of so distinguished a person as the Count. It
        had been found large enough by its previous owners, men of moderate
        means and, it so happened, of small families; and the Count, feeling
        that his occupation of it might be terminated at any time, had not
        cared to add to it. Its situation was re<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page38">[pg 38]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>markably pleasing. Behind it was a sheltering
        range of hills,<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href=
        "#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> keeping
        off the force of the south-westerly winds, and then richly covered
        with wood. It was not too near the sea, the Romans not finding that
        the ceaseless disturbance of rising and falling tides was an element
        of pleasure, though they could not get too close to their own
        tideless Mediterranean; but it was within an easy distance of the
        Haven.<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href=
        "#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> The
        convenience of this neighbourhood had indeed been one of the Count’s
        reasons for selecting this spot. But if the harsh, grating sound of
        the waves upon the shingle did not reach the ears of the dwellers in
        the villa, and the force of the sea winds was somewhat broken for
        them by intervening cliffs, they still enjoyed all the freshness and
        vitality of an air that had come across many a league of water. The
        climate, too, was genial, mild without being too soft, mostly free
        from damp, though not exempt from occasional mist, seldom troubled by
        frost or snow, and, on the whole, not unlike some of the more
        temperate regions of Italy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The villa, with
        its belongings, occupied three sides of a square, or rather
        rectangle, and was built nearly to the points of the compass. The
        eastern side of the square was open, thus giving a prospect
        sea<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg 39]</span><a name="Pg039"
        id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>wards. The western contained
        the principal living rooms. The northern, too, was partly occupied by
        bed-chambers and sitting-rooms, for which there was no room in the
        comparatively small portion which had been originally intended for
        the residence of the owner and his family. Some of the workmen
        employed lived in cottages outside the villa enclosure. The southern
        was devoted to storehouses, workshops, and all the miscellaneous
        buildings which made a Roman villa, as far as possible, an
        establishment complete in itself. The open space was occupied by a
        pretty garden, which will be more particularly described
        hereafter.<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href=
        "#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The eastward front
        of the villa was occupied for the greater part of its length by a
        colonnade or corridor. A low wall of about four feet in height
        separated this from the garden; above the wall it was open to the
        air; but an overhanging roof helped greatly to shelter it, while the
        view into the garden was unimpeded. The floor was adorned with a
        handsome tesselated pavement, the principal device <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg 40]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of which was a representation of the
        favourite subject of Orpheus attracting beasts and birds by his lyre.
        The proprietor from whom the Count had purchased the villa had
        brought it from Italy. He was a Christian of artistic tastes, and,
        like his fellow-believers, had delighted to trace in the old myth a
        spiritual meaning, the power of the teaching of Christ to subdue to
        the Divine obedience the savage, animal nature of man. He had
        displaced for it the original design, which, indeed, was nothing
        better than a commonplace representation of dancing figures which had
        satisfied the earlier owners. The artist had included among the
        listeners animals, some of which, as the monkey, the Thracian
        minstrel could hardly have seen, and, with a certain touch of humour,
        he had adorned the monkey’s head with a Phrygian cap, like that which
        Orpheus himself wore, to indicate probably that the monkey is the
        caricature of man. The inner wall was ornamented with a bold design
        of Cæsar’s first landing in Britain, worked in fresco. Seats and
        tables were arranged along it at intervals, and the whole corridor
        was thus made to furnish a pleasant promenade in winter and a
        charming resort when the weather was warm.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the south end
        of the corridor was the Count’s own apartment, or study, as it would
        be called in a modern house. One window looked into the corridor,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page41">[pg 41]</span><a name="Pg041"
        id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>into which a door also opened;
        another, which was built out into the shape of a bow, so as to catch
        as much of the sun as the aspect allowed, looked into the garden.
        Part of it was formed of lattices, which admitted of being completely
        closed when the weather required such protection; the rest was glazed
        with glass, which would have seemed rough to the present generation,
        but was quite as good as most people were content to have in their
        houses fifty years ago. The pavement was tesselated, and presented
        various designs, a Bacchante, and a pair of gladiators among them.
        These, however, were commonly covered with thick woollen rugs, the
        villa being chiefly used as a winter residence. The Count had not
        forgotten his early studies, and some handsome bookcases contained
        his favourite authors, among which were to be found the great classic
        poets of Rome, Tacitus, for whom he had a special regard, some
        writers on the military art, Cato and Columella on agriculture, and,
        not least honoured, though some, at least, of their contents had but
        little interest for him—for, sincere Christian as he was, he cared
        little for controversy—the numerous treatises of his friend and
        teacher, Augustine. Behind this room was a simple furnished
        bed-chamber, showing in an almost bare simplicity the characteristic
        tastes of a soldier.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the other end
        of the corridor was a door leading to the principal chamber in this
        part of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg
        042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>villa. This measured altogether close upon forty
        feet in length, but it was divided, or rather could be divided, into
        two by columns which stood about halfway down its longer sides, and
        between which a curtain could be hung. When the chamber was occupied
        in summer it might be used as a whole; in the winter the smaller
        part, which looked out into the garden, could be shut off from the
        rest by drawing the curtain, and so made a comfortable room, warmed
        from below by hot air from the furnace, which had been constructed at
        the western end of the northern wing of the villa. Much artistic
        skill had been expended on the pavements of the apartment, and the
        smaller chamber was very richly decorated in this way. In the middle
        was a large head of Medusa, and the rest was filled with
        beautifully-worked scenes illustrating the pleasures of a pastoral
        life. It was the custom of the Count’s family to use the larger
        portion of the whole chamber as a dining-room, the smaller as a
        ladies’ boudoir. On the rare occasion of some large entertainment
        being given, the whole was thrown into one.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ladies of the
        family, of whom we shall hear more hereafter, had their own
        apartments at the western end of the north wing, part of which was
        shut off for their occupation and for their immediate attendants. A
        covered way connected this with the portion occupied by the
        Count.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page43">[pg 43]</span><a name=
        "Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be
        needless to describe the rest of the villa. It was like the houses of
        its kind, houses which the Romans erected wherever they went in as
        close an imitation as they could make of what they were accustomed to
        at home.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The garden,
        however, must not be wholly passed over. Spacious and handsome as it
        was, it in part presented a stiff and unnatural appearance, looking,
        in fact, somewhat theatrical, as contrasted with the pastoral
        sunniness of the landscape. A Roman gardener had been brought from
        Rome—one skilled in all the arts of his craft. It was he who had
        terraced the slope with so much regularity, had planted stiff box
        hedges—and, above all, it was his taste which led him to cut and
        train box and laburnum shrubs into fantastic imitations of other
        forms. The poor trees were forced to abandon their own natural
        shapes, and to pose as vases, geometrical figures, and animals of
        various kinds. There was even a ship of box surrounded by a broad
        channel of water, so that the spectator, making large demands on his
        imagination, might imagine that the little mock vessel was moored on
        a still sheet of water. Among the box trees were stone fountains
        badly copied from classic models. But these had not remained in their
        bare crudity. The loving British ivy had crept close around them, and
        added a grace which the sculptor had failed to give. The Roman
        gardener would have liked to banish <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page44">[pg 44]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>this intruder, or to at least train it into the
        positions prescribed by horticultural rules, but he had been bidden
        to let it run at its own sweet will; and so it had, and had
        flourished, well nursed by the soft and humid atmosphere.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Scattered at
        regular intervals through the green were flower-beds stocked with
        plants, which were either native to the island, or had been brought
        hither with great care from the capital. There were roses in several
        varieties, strange-shaped orchids, which had been found growing wild
        at lower levels of the island, and adopted into this civilized garden
        to ornament it with their unique beauty. Gay geraniums and other
        flowers made throughout the summer bright patches of colour in
        striking contrast to the dark green.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These beds were
        enclosed by borders. Between these enclosures were curiously-cut
        letters of growing box, which perpetuated—at least for the life-time
        of the shrub—the gardener’s own name or that of his master, or
        classic titles, to serve as designations for certain portions of the
        place. In the midst of the garden several luxuriant oaks and graceful
        elms had been allowed to retain in their native freedom the shapes
        into which they had been growing for so many years. They cast wide
        shadows, and gave a softened aspect to the unnatural shapes of the
        trained growths.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg
        45]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Beyond the floral
        division of the garden was another enclosure for pear and apple
        trees. They stood on a green sward, soft as velvet, and of a deeper
        hue than Italian suns permit to the grass on which they smile. Here,
        too, were foreign embellishments. The monotony of the uniform rows of
        fruit trees was varied by pyramids of box, and the whole orchard was
        surrounded by a belt of plane trees.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A circle of oaks
        had been left at the summit of one of the terraces. Thick hedges were
        planted between the trees, making a dense wall, in which openings
        were cut for the view, so that the vista was visible, like a picture
        set in a dark frame. This green room, roofed by the sky, was paved
        with a mosaic of the bright coloured chalk from the cliffs at the
        western end of the island, and contained an oblong basin of water
        shaped like a table. The water flowed through so gently that the
        surface always seemed at rest, and yet never grew warm. Couches were
        placed at this fountain table, and from time to time repasts were
        served here, certain viands being placed in dishes shaped like swans
        or boats, which floated gracefully on the watery surface. The more
        solid meats were placed on the broad marble edges of the basin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This sylvan
        retreat seemed made for a meeting of naiads and nereids. In short,
        the spot was so <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page46">[pg
        46]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>sheltered, the outlook over sea and land both
        near and across the strait so fair, that one could well believe even
        Pliny’s famed Tuscan garden, which may have suggested some features
        of this British one, was not more happily placed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Ælius had
        come, some eighteen years before the beginning of our story, to take
        up his command on the coast of Britain, he had brought with him his
        young wife. This lady, always delicate in health, had not long
        survived her transplantation to a northern climate. Six months after
        her arrival in Britain she had died in giving birth to a daughter.
        The child was entrusted to the care of a British woman, wife of the
        sailing master of one of the Roman ships, who had reared her together
        with her own daughter. When little Ælia was but a few weeks old her
        foster-mother had become a widow, her husband having met with his
        death in a desperate encounter with one of the Saxon cruisers. This
        misfortune had been followed by another, the loss of her two elder
        children, who had been carried off by a malarious fever. The widow,
        thus doubly bereaved, had thankfully accepted the Count’s offer that
        she <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page48">[pg 48]</span><a name=
        "Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>should take the post of
        mother of the maids in his household. Her foster-daughter, a feeble
        little thing, whom she had the greatest difficulty in rearing, was as
        dear to her as was her own child, and the new arrangement ensured
        that she should not be separated from her. For ten years she was as
        happy as a woman who had lost so much could hope to be. She had the
        pleasure of seeing her delicate nursling pass safely through
        childhood, and grow into a handsome, vigorous girl. Then her own call
        came; and feeling that her earthly work was done, she had been glad
        to meet it. The Count, who was a frequent visitor to her deathbed,
        had no difficulty in promising her that the two children should never
        be separated. Indeed he could not have divided the pair even had he
        wished. Every wish of the ten-year-old Ælia was as a law to him, and
        Ælia would have simply broken her heart to lose her playmate and
        sister Carna.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two friends
        were curiously unlike in person and disposition. Ælia was a Roman of
        the Romans. Her hair was of a shining blue-black hue, and so abundant
        that when unbound it fell almost to her knees. Her black eyes, soft
        and lustrous in repose, and shaded with lashes of the very longest,
        could give an almost formidable flash when anything had roused her to
        anger. Her complexion was a rich brown, relieved by a slight ruddy
        tinge; her features regular, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page49">[pg
        49]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>less
        delicately carved, indeed, than the Greek type, but full of
        expression, which was tender or fiery, according to her mood. Her
        figure was somewhat small, but beautifully formed. If Ælia was
        unmistakably Roman, Carna showed equally clearly one of the finest
        British types. She was tall, overtopping her companion by at least a
        head; her hair, which fell in curls about her shoulders, was of a
        glossy chestnut; her eyes of the very deepest blue; her complexion,
        half-way between blonde and brunette, mantled with a delicate colour,
        which deepened, when her emotions were touched, into an exquisite
        blush; her forehead was somewhat low, but broad, and with a rare
        promise both of artistic power and of intelligence; her nose would
        have been pronounced by a casual observer to be the most faulty
        feature in her face; and it is true that its outline was not perfect.
        But the same observer, after a brief acquaintance, would probably
        have retracted his censure, and owned that this feature suited the
        rest of her face, and would have been less charming if it had been
        more perfect. Ælia was impulsive and quick of temper, honest and
        affectionate, but not caring to go below the surface of things, and
        without a particle of imagination. Carna, on the other hand, seemed
        the gentlest of women. Those blue eyes of hers were ready to express
        affection and pity; but no one—not even Ælia, who could be
        exceedingly provoking at times—had ever seen a <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg 50]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>flash of anger in them. But her nature had
        depths in it that none suspected to be there; it was richly endowed
        with all the best gifts of her Celtic race. She had a world of her
        own with which the gay Roman girl, whom she loved so dearly, and with
        whom she seemed to share all her thoughts, had nothing to do. Music
        touched her soul in a way of which Ælia, who could sing very
        charmingly, and play with no little expression on the <span lang="la"
        class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">cithara</span></span>, had no conception. And
        though she had never written, or even composed, a verse, and possibly
        would never write or compose one, she was a poetess. At present all
        her soul was given to religion, religion full of the imagination and
        enthusiasm which has made saints of so many women of her race. The
        good British priest, to whose flock she belonged, a worthy man who
        eked out his scanty income<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href=
        "#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> by
        working a small farm, was perplexed by her enthusiasm. She was not
        satisfied with the duties of adorning the little church where he
        ministered, and its humble altar-cloths and vestments, by the skill
        of her nimble fingers, of aiding the chants with the rich tones of
        her beautiful voice, of ministering to the sick. She performed these,
        indeed, with devotion, but she demanded more, and the good man did
        not know how to satisfy her. In addition to her other gifts Carna had
        that of being <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page51">[pg
        51]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a
        born nurse. It was her first impulse to fly to the help of
        anything—whether it was man, or beast, or bird—that was sick or hurt,
        just as it was Ælia’s impulse, though she mastered it at any strong
        call of duty, to avoid the sight of suffering. She had now heard that
        a prisoner had been brought in desperately wounded, and she could not
        rest till she knew whether she could do anything for the poor
        creature’s soul or body. Ælia was as scornful as her love for her
        foster-sister allowed her to be.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My dearest Carna,”</span> she cried, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“what on earth can make you trouble yourself in this
        fashion about this miserable creature? They are the worst plagues in
        this world, these Saxons, and it would be a blessing to the world if
        it were well quit of the whole race of them! A set of pagan
        dogs!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, sister,”</span> said Carna, her eyes brimming with
        tears, <span class="tei tei-q">“that is the worst of it. A pagan, who
        has never heard of the Blessed Lord, and now, they say, he is dying!
        What shall we do for him?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But surely,”</span> returned the other, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“he is no worse off than his threescore companions who
        went to the bottom the other day.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“God be good to them,”</span> said Carna, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“but then we did not know them, and that seems to make a
        difference. And to think that this poor creature should be so near to
        the way and not find it. But I must go and see
        him.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page52">[pg
        52]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It will only tear your poor, tender heart for no
        purpose. You had far better come and talk to father.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carna was not to
        be persuaded, but hurried to the chamber to which the wounded man had
        been borne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was evident at
        first sight that the end was not far off. The dying Saxon lay
        stretched on a rude pallet. He was a young man, who could scarcely
        have seen as many as twenty summers, for the down was hardly to be
        seen on his upper lip and chin. His face, which was curiously fair
        for one who had followed from infancy an outdoor life, was deadly
        pale, a pathetic contrast with the red-gold hair which fell in curly
        profusion about it. His eyes, in which the fire was almost quenched,
        were wide open, and fixed with an unchanging gaze upon a figure that
        stood motionless at the foot of the bed. This was his brother, who
        had been permitted by the humanity of the Count to be present. They
        had been exchanging a few sentences, but the dying man was now too
        far gone to speak, and the two could only look their last farewell to
        each other. It was a pitiful thing to see the twins, so like in
        feature and form, but now so different, the one, prisoner as he was,
        full of life and strength, the other on the very threshold of
        death.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the side of the
        wounded man stood the household physician, a venerable-looking slave,
        who had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg 53]</span><a name=
        "Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>acquired such knowledge
        of medicine and surgery as sufficed for the treatment of the commoner
        ailments and accidents. This case was beyond his skill, or indeed the
        skill of any man. He could do nothing but from time to time put a few
        drops of cordial between the sufferer’s lips. Next to the physician
        stood the priest, and his skill, too, seemed to be at fault. A
        messenger, sent by Carna, had warned him that a dying man required
        his ministrations, but had added no further particulars, and the
        worthy man, who was busy at the time in littering down his cattle,
        had hastily changed his working dress for his priestly habiliments,
        and had come ready, as he thought, to administer the last
        consolations of the Church to a dying Christian. The case utterly
        perplexed him. He had tried the two languages with which he was
        familiar, and found them useless. No one had been able to understand
        a single word of the dialogue which had passed between the brothers.
        The dying stranger was as hopelessly separated from him and the means
        of grace that he could command as if he had been a thousand miles
        away. He could not even venture—for his theology was of the narrowest
        type—to commend to the mercy of God the passing soul of this
        unbaptized heathen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carna understood
        the situation at a glance. She saw death in the Saxon’s face; she saw
        the hopeless perplexity in the expression of the
        priest.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        you do nothing, nothing at all for this poor soul?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My daughter,”</span> said the priest, <span class=

        nothing.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Baptize him without a profession of repentance, without
        a confession of faith! Impossible!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Will you let him perish before your eyes without an
        effort to save him?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Child,”</span> said the priest, with some impatience in
        his tone, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have told you that I am
        helpless. It was not I that brought these things about.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The girl cast an
        agonized look about the room, as of one that appealed for help, and
        seized a crucifix that hung upon the wall. She threw herself upon her
        knees by the bedside, and after pressing the symbol of Redemption
        passionately to her lips, held it to the mouth of the dying man. The
        Saxon, on his first entrance into the room, had removed his look from
        his brother and fixed it steadfastly on this beautiful apparition.
        Clad in white from head to foot, with a golden girdle about her
        waist, her eyes shining with excitement, her whole face transfigured
        by a passion of pity, she seemed to him a vision from another world,
        one of the Walhalla maidens of whom his mother had talked to him in
        days gone by. His lips closed feebly on the crucifix which she held
        to them; a smile lighted up his fading eyes, and he <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page55">[pg 55]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>muttered with his last breath <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Valkyria.”</span> The girl heard the word and remembered
        without understanding it. The next moment he was dead, and one of the
        women standing by stepped forward and closed his eyes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carna burst into a
        passion of tears.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He is gone,”</span> she cried, amidst her sobs,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“he is gone, and we could not help
        him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The priest was
        silent. He had no consolation to offer. Indeed, but that he
        recognized the girl’s saintliness—a saintliness to which he, worthy
        man as he was, had no pretensions—he would have thought her grief
        foolish. But the old physician could not keep silence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pardon me, lady,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“if I seem to reprove you. I pray you not to suffer your
        zeal for the salvation of souls to overpower your faith. Do you think
        that the All-Father does not love this poor stranger as well as you,
        nay, better than you can love him? that He cannot care for him as
        well? that you, forsooth, must save him out of His hands? Nay, my
        daughter—pardon an old man for the word—do not so distrust
        Him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You are right, father, as always,”</span> said the girl.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I have been selfish and faithless. I was
        angry, I suppose, to find myself baffled and helpless. You must set
        me a penance, father,”</span> she added, turning to the
        priest.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page56">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Saxon
        meanwhile had contrived by his gestures to make his guards understand
        that he wished to take his farewell of his dead brother. They allowed
        him to approach the bed. He stooped and kissed the lips of the dead,
        and then, choking down the sobs which convulsed his breast, turned
        away, seemingly calm and unmoved. But as he passed Carna he contrived
        to catch with his manacled hands one of the flowing sleeves of her
        white robe, and to lift the hem to his lips.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not easy to
        know what should be done with the survivor of the two Saxon captives.
        The villa had no proper provision for the safe custody of prisoners;
        and the problem of keeping a man under lock and key, without a quite
        disproportionate amount of trouble, was as difficult as it would be
        in the ordinary country house of modern times.</p>

        to keep him unless we chain him hand and foot, or set half a dozen

        seems ready, from what I have seen, to worship her. And besides, what
        harm can he do? He has no arms, and he can’t speak a word of any

        or be starved to death.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        at home everything about him seemed to show—nothing more than his
        hands, which were delicate, and unusually small in proportion to his
        almost gigantic stature. But the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page59">[pg 59]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>greatest chief among his people would not have
        disdained the hammer and anvil. Was not Thor a mighty smith? And was
        it not almost as much a great warrior’s business to make a good sword
        as to wield it well when it was made? So the young man, whose mighty
        shoulders and muscular arms were regarded with respect and even
        astonishment by his British fellow-workmen, laboured with a will,
        showing himself no mean craftsman in the blacksmith’s art. Sometimes,
        as he plied the hammer, he would chant to himself, in a low voice,
        what sounded like a war-song. Otherwise he remained absolutely
        silent, not even attempting to pick up the few common words which
        daily intercourse with his companions gave him the opportunity of
        learning. There was an air of dignity about him which seemed to
        forbid any of the little affronts to which a prisoner would naturally
        be exposed; his evidently enormous strength, too, was a thing which
        even the most stupid of his companions respected. Silent,
        self-contained, and impassive, he moved quietly about his daily
        tasks; it was only when he caught a glimpse of Carna that his
        features were lighted up for a moment with a smile.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The idea of
        opening up any communication with him seemed hopeless, when an
        unexpected, but still quite natural, way out of the difficulty
        presented itself. An old peddler, who was accustomed to <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page60">[pg 60]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>supply the inmates of the villa with silks
        and jewellery, and who sometimes had a book in his pack for Carna,
        paid in due course one of his periodical visits. The old man was a
        Gaul by birth, a native of one of the States on the eastern bank of
        the Rhine, and in youth he had been an adventurous trader, extending
        his journeys eastward and northward as far as the shores of the
        Baltic. The risk was great, for the Germans of the interior looked
        with suspicion on the visits of civilized strangers; but, on the
        other hand, the profits were considerable. Amber, in pieces of a size
        and clearness seldom matched on the coasts of Gaul and Britain, and
        beautiful furs, as of the seal and the sea-otter, could be bought at
        very low prices from these unsophisticated tribes, and sold again to
        the wealthy ladies of Lutetia<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19"
        href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> and

        "#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> at a
        very considerable advantage. In these wanderings Antrix—for that was
        the peddler’s name—had acquired a good knowledge of the
        language—substantially the same, though divided into several
        dialects—spoken by the German tribes; and, indeed, without such
        knowledge his trading adventures would have been neither safe nor
        profitable. As he approached old age Antrix had judged it expedient
        to transfer his business from Gaul to Britain. Gaul <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page61">[pg 61]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he found to be a dangerous place for a
        peaceable trader, having lost more than once all the profits of a
        journey, and, indeed, a good deal more, by one of the marauding bands
        by whom the country was periodically overrun. Britain, or at least
        the southern district of Britain, was certainly safer, and it was
        this that for the last ten years he had been accustomed to traverse,
        till he had become a well-known and welcome visitor at every villa
        and settlement along the coast.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here then chance,
        or, as Carna preferred to think, Providence, had provided an
        interpreter; and it so happened that, whether by another piece of
        good fortune, or an additional interposition, his services were made
        permanently useful. The old man had found his journeys becoming in
        the winter too laborious for his strength, and it was not very
        difficult to persuade him to make his home in the villa for two or
        three months till the severity of the season should have passed.
        Every one was pleased at the arrangement. Antrix was an admirable
        teller of tales, and his had been an adventurous life, full of
        incident, with which he knew how to make the winter night less long.
        The Count saw a rare opportunity, such as had never come to him
        before, of learning something about the hardy freebooters whom it was
        his business to overawe; and Carna had the liveliest hopes of making
        a proselyte, if she <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page62">[pg
        62]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>could
        only make herself, and the message in which she had so profound a
        faith, understood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young Saxon’s
        resolution and pride did not long hold out against the unexpected
        delight of being able once more to converse in his own language, and
        he soon began to talk with perfect freedom—for, he had no idea of
        having anything to conceal—about his home and his people. He was the
        son, they learnt from him, of the chief of one of the Saxon
        settlements near the mouth of the Albis.<a id="noteref_21" name=
        "noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> The
        people lived by hunting and fishing, and, more or less, by
        cultivating the soil. But life was hard. The settlements were
        crowded; game was growing scarce, and had to be followed further
        afield every year; the climate, too, was very uncertain, and the
        crops sometimes failed altogether. In short, they could not live
        without what they were able to pick up in their expeditions to richer
        countries and more temperate climates. On this point the young Saxon
        was perfectly frank. The idea that there was anything of which a
        warrior could possibly be ashamed in taking what he could by the
        strong hand had evidently never crossed his mind. To rob a neighbour
        or fellow-tribesman he counted shameful—so much could be gathered
        from expressions that he let drop; as to others, his simple morality
        was this—to keep what you had, to take what others could not keep.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page63">[pg 63]</span><a name="Pg063"
        id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>The Count found him curiously
        well informed on what may be called the politics of Europe. He was
        well aware of the decay of the Roman power. Kinsmen and neighbours of
        his own had made their way south to get their share in the spoil of
        the Empire. Some, he had heard, had stopped to take service with the
        enemy; some had come back with marvellous tales of the wealth and
        luxury which they had seen. About Britain itself he had very clear
        views. The substance of what he said to the Count was this:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“You won’t stop here very long. My father
        says that you have been weakening your fleet and armies here for
        years past, and that you will soon take them away altogether. Then we
        shall come and take the country. It will hardly be in his time, he
        says. Perhaps it may not be in mine. It is only you that hinder us;
        it is only you that we are afraid of. We shall have the island; we
        must have it. Our own country is too small and too barren to keep
        us.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of his own
        adventures the young Saxon had little to say. This was the first
        voyage that he and his brother had taken. Their father was in failing
        health, and their mother, who had but one other child, a girl some
        ten years younger, had kept them at home, till she had been
        unwillingly persuaded that they were losing caste by taking no part
        in the warlike excursions of their countrymen. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We had a fairly successful <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page64">[pg 64]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>time,”</span> went on the young chief, with the
        absolute unconsciousness of wrong with which a hunter might relate
        his exploits; <span class="tei tei-q">“took two merchantmen that had
        good cargoes on board, and had a right royal fight with the people of
        a town on the Gallic coast. We killed thirty of them; and only five
        of our warriors went to the Walhalla. Then we turned homeward, but
        our ship struck on a rock near some islands far to the west,<a id=
        "noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> and had
        almost gone to the bottom. With great labour we dragged her ashore,
        and set to work repairing her; but our chief smith and carpenter had
        fallen in the battle, and we were a long time in making her fit for
        sea. This was the reason why we were going home so late, and also why
        we lagged behind our comrades when you were chasing us. By rights we
        were the best crew and had the swiftest ship, but she had been
        clumsily mended, and dragged terribly in the water.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count listened
        to all this with the greatest interest, and plied the speaker with
        questions, all of which he answered with perfect frankness. He found
        out how many warriors the settlement could muster, what were the
        relations with their neighbours, whether there had been any definite
        plans for a common expedition. On the whole, he came to the
        conclusion that though there was no danger of an overpowering
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page65">[pg 65]</span><a name="Pg065"
        id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>migration from this quarter
        such as Western and Southern Europe had suffered from in former
        times, these sea-faring tribes of the East would be an increasing
        danger to Britain as years went on. Personally the prospect did not
        concern him greatly; his fortunes were not bound up with the island.
        Still he loved the place and its people; it troubled him to see what
        dark days were in store for them. And taking a wider view—for he was
        a man of large sympathies—he was grieved to see another black cloud
        in an horizon already so dark. Would anything civilized be left, he
        thought to himself, when every part of Europe has been swept by these
        hosts of barbarians?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before long
        another source of interest was discovered in the young Saxon. The
        Count happened to overhear him chanting to himself, and though he
        could not distinguish the words, he recognized in the rhythm
        something like the camp-songs that he had often listened to from
        German warriors in Stilicho’s camp. Here again the peddler’s services
        as an interpreter were put in requisition, and though the old man’s
        Latin, which went little beyond his practical wants as a trader, fell
        lamentably short of what was wanted, enough was heard to interest the
        villa family, which had a literary turn, very much. What the young
        man had sung to himself was an early Saga, a curious romance<a id=
        "noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> of
        heroes fighting with monsters, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page66">[pg 66]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>as unlike as can be conceived to anything to be
        found in Roman poetry—verse in its rudest shape, but still making
        itself felt as a real poet’s work.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lastly, Carna, now
        that she had found a way of communicating her thoughts, threw herself
        with ardour into the work of proselytizing the stranger. Here the
        peddler was more at home in his task as interpreter. Carna used the
        dialect of South Britain, with which he was far more familiar than he
        was with Latin—it differed indeed but little from his native speech.
        The topics too were familiar, for he had been brought up in the
        Christian faith, and though he scarcely understood the girl’s zeal,
        he was quite willing to help her as much as he could.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carna found her
        task much more difficult than she had expected. She had thought in
        her simple faith that it would be enough for her to tell to the young
        heathen the story of the Crucified Christ for him to fall down at
        once and worship. He listened with profound attention and respect.
        This, perhaps, he would have accorded to anything that came from her
        lips; but, beyond this, the story itself profoundly interested him.
        But it must be confessed that there was a good deal in it which did
        not commend itself to his warrior’s ideal of what the God whom he
        could worship should be. He was a soldier, and he could scarcely
        conceive of anything great or good that was outside a soldier’s
        virtues. The gods of his own <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page67">[pg
        67]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>heaven, Odin and Thor and Balder, were great
        conquerors, armed with armour which no mortal blow could pierce,
        wielders of sword and hammer which were too heavy for any mortal arm
        to wield. He could bow down to them because they were greater,
        immeasurably greater than himself, in the qualities and gifts which
        he most honoured. Now he was called upon to receive a quite different
        set of ideas, to set up a quite different standard of excellence. The
        story of the Gospels touched him. It roused him almost to fury when
        he heard how the good man who had gone about healing the sick and
        feeding the hungry had been put shamefully to death by His own
        countrymen, by those who knew best what He had done. If Carna had
        bidden him avenge the man who had been so ungratefully treated, he
        would have performed her bidding with pleasure. But to worship this
        Crucified One, to depose for Him Odin, Lord of Battles—that seemed
        impossible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still he was
        impressed, and impressed chiefly by the way in which the preacher
        seemed to translate into her own life the principles of the faith
        which she tried to set forth to him. She had told him that this
        Crucified One had died for him. He could not understand why He should
        have done so, why He should not have led His twelve legions of angels
        against the wicked, swept them off from the face of the earth, and
        established by force of arms a kingdom of justice. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page68">[pg 68]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Still the idea of so much having been
        given, so much endured for his sake touched him, especially when he
        saw how passionately in earnest was this wonderful creature, this
        beautiful prophetess, as, with the German reverence for women, he was
        ready to regard her, how eager she was to do him good, how little, as
        he could not but feel, she thought of herself in comparison with
        others.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As long as Carna
        dwelt on these topics she made good way; when she wandered away from
        them, as naturally she sometimes did, she was not so successful. One
        day it unluckily occurred to her that she would appeal to his
        fears.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Do not refuse to listen,”</span> she said to him,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“for if He is infinitely good to those who
        love Him, He can also be angry with those who love Him
        not.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And neither for
        that day nor for many days to come would he speak again on this
        subject. Carna was greatly troubled; but she began to think whether
        there might not be something in what the young man had said.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our story must now
        go back a little, and take up the course of events at the camp, where
        the look of affairs was not promising. The donative promised by
        Constantine on the day of his election had been paid, but this had
        been done only after the greatest exertions in wringing money out of
        unlucky traders, farmers, and even peasants, who had been already
        squeezed almost dry. All that had any coin left were beginning to
        bury it,<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href=
        "#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a> and
        though the collectors of taxes, or loans, or gifts, or whatever else
        the frequent requisition of money might be called, had ingenious ways
        of discovering or making their owners give up these hoards, it was
        quite evident that very little more could be got out of Britain. The
        military chest meanwhile was becoming alarmingly empty, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page71">[pg 71]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and though money was still found somehow
        for the larger camps, some of the less important garrisons had been
        left for months with almost nothing in the way of pay. What was to be
        done was a pressing question, which had to be answered in some way
        within a few days. If it was not so answered, it was tolerably plain
        that Constantine would meet the fate of Marcus and Gratianus. The
        Emperor himself (if we are to give him this title) seemed to be very
        little troubled by the prospect, and remained stolidly calm. His
        elevation indeed had made the least possible difference to him. He
        drank a better kind of wine, and perhaps a little more—for his cups
        had been limited by his means—but he did not run into excess. He was
        still the same simple, contented, good-natured man that he had always
        been. But his sons were of another temper, though curiously differing
        from each other. Constans the elder was an enthusiast, almost a
        fanatic, a man of strong religious feeling, who would have followed
        the religious life if it had been possible, and who now, finding
        himself possessed of power, had schemes of using it to promote his
        favourite schemes. Julian the younger had ambitions of a more
        commonplace kind. But both the brothers were agreed in holding on to
        the power that had been so strangely put into their father’s hands,
        hands which, as he had very little will of his own, were practically
        theirs.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A council was held
        at which Constantine, his two sons, and three of the officers of
        highest rank were present, and the urgent question of the day was
        anxiously debated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Julian began the
        discussion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have some one to introduce to your Majesty,”</span>
        said one of the officers present, <span class="tei tei-q">“who may

        Ierne,<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let him enter,”</span> said Constantine, with his usual
        dull phlegmatic voice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tribune went
        to the door of the chamber, and despatched a message to his quarters.
        In a few minutes the stranger was introduced into the council. He was
        a man verging upon middle age, somewhat short of stature, with a
        great bush of fiery-red hair, which stood up from his head with a
        very fierce look, a long, shaggy beard of the same colour, eyes of
        the deepest blue, very bright and piercing, but with a <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page73">[pg 73]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>wandering and unsteady look in them, and a
        ruddy complexion which deepened to an intense colour on his cheek
        bones and other prominent parts of his face. Around his neck he wore
        a heavy twisted collar of remarkably red gold. Massive rings of the
        same metal adorned his fingers. His dress was of undyed wool, and
        very rudely shaped, a curious contrast to the richness of his
        ornaments. He was followed into the room by an interpreter, a young
        native of Northern Britain, who had been carried off by Irish pirates
        from one of the ecclesiastical schools. He had been taught Latin
        before his captivity, and, while a captive, had made himself
        acquainted with the Irish language, which indeed did not differ very
        much from that spoken in Britain.<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26"
        href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a> His task
        of interpreter was not by any means an easy one to fulfil. The Prince
        broke out into a rapid torrent of complaint, invective, and entreaty,
        which left the young man, who was not very expert in either of the
        languages with which he had to deal, hopelessly behind. Then seeing
        that he was not followed, he turned on his unlucky attendant and
        dealt him a blow upon the ear that sent him staggering across the
        room. Then he seemed to remember himself, and began to tell his story
        again at a more moderate rate of speed, though he still from time to
        time, when he came to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page74">[pg
        74]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>some
        peculiarly exciting part in the tale of his wrongs, broke out into a
        rapid eloquence that baffled all interpretation. The upshot of the
        story was this—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was, or rather
        had been, a small king in South-eastern Ireland,<a id="noteref_27"
        name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        eldest of four brothers, having succeeded his father about ten years
        before. There had been a quarrel about the division of some property.
        The Prince was a little obscure in his description of the property;
        indeed it was a matter about which he was shrewd enough to say as
        little as possible. But his hearers had no difficulty in presuming
        that it consisted of spoil carried off from Britain. The quarrel had
        come to blows. All the nation had been divided into parties in the
        dispute. Finally he had been compelled by his ungrateful subjects to
        fly for his life. Would the Emperor bring him back? He was liberal,
        even extravagant, in his offers. He would bring the whole island
        under his dominion. (As a matter of fact, his dominions had never
        reached more than seventy miles inland, and he had contrived to make
        himself so hated during his ten years’ reign that he had scarcely a
        friend or follower left.) And what an island it was! There never was
        such a place. The sheep were fatter, the cows gave more milk than in
        any other place in the whole world. And there was <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page75">[pg 75]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gold too, gold to be had for the picking
        up; and amber on the shores, and pearls in the rivers. In short, it
        was a treasure-house of wealth, which was waiting for the lucky
        first-comer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Are you a Christian?”</span> asked Constans.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The exiled chief
        would have gladly said that he was, and indeed for a moment thought
        of the audacious fiction that his attachment to the new faith had
        been one of the causes of his expulsion. He was, in fact, a savagely
        bigoted pagan, and had dealt very roughly with one or two
        missionaries who had ventured into his neighbourhood. But he
        reflected that the falsehood would infallibly be detected, and would
        inevitably do him a great deal of harm.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No!”</span> he exclaimed; <span class="tei tei-q">“would
        that I were. But there is nothing that I so much desire if only I
        could attain to that blessing. But I promise to be baptized myself,
        and to have every man, woman, and child within my dominions baptized
        within a month, if you will only bring me back to them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even Constans
        thought this zeal to be a little excessive.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And how many men can you bring into the field?”</span>
        asked the more practical Julian; <span class="tei tei-q">“and what
        money can you find for the pay of the soldiers?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The stranger was
        taken aback at these direct questions.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page76">[pg 76]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I don’t believe,”</span> said one of the tribunes in
        Latin to Julian, <span class="tei tei-q">“that he has any subjects

        wears on his neck and his fingers.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Shall he withdraw?”</span> said Julian to his
        father.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Constantine, who
        never spoke when he could avoid speaking, answered by a nod, and the
        Irish Prince withdrew.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let us have nothing to do,”</span> said the practical
        Julian, <span class="tei tei-q">“with these Irish savages. They may
        cut their own throats, and welcome, without our helping them. The
        men, too, would rebel at the bare mention of Ierne. It is out of the
        world in their eyes, and I think they are about right. And as to the
        gold and pearls, I don’t believe in them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        would be a great work to bring over a new nation to the orthodox
        faith.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Julian answered
        with a laugh. <span class="tei tei-q">“My good brother, we are not
        all such zealous missionaries as you. I am afraid that preaching is
        not exactly the work which our friends the soldiers are looking out

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What does your Majesty say to an expedition to chastise

        suggestion of one of the tribunes.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What is to be got?”</span> was Julian’s answer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Glory!”</span> answered the tribune.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Glory! What is that?—the men want pay and plunder. These
        bare-legged villains haven’t so much as a rag that you can take from
        them, and they have a shrewd way of giving at least as many hard
        blows as they take. No!—we will leave the Picts alone, and only too
        thankful if they will do the same for us!”</span></p>

        bringing him to reason.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Constantine spoke
        for the first time since the council had begun its
        sitting—<span class="tei tei-q">“The Count is a good man and does his
        business well. Leave him alone.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Other suggestions
        were made and discussed without any sensible approach to a
        conclusion, and the council broke up, but with an understanding that
        it should meet again with as little delay as possible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the afternoon
        of that very day an incident occurred which convinced every one—if
        further conviction was needed—that delay would certainly be
        fatal.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A party of
        soldiers was practising javelin throwing, and Constantine, who had
        been particularly expert in this exercise in his youth, stood
        watching the game. He had stepped up to examine the mark <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg 78]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>made by one of the weapons on the wooden
        figure at which the men were throwing, when a javelin passed most
        perilously near his head and buried itself in the wood. It could not
        have been an accident; no one could have been so recklessly careless
        as to throw under the circumstances. Constantine was as imperturbable
        as usual. Without a sign of fear or anger, he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Comrades, you mistake; I am not made of wood,”</span>
        and, signing to his attendants, walked quietly away. The incident,
        however, made a great impression upon him, and a still greater upon
        his sons.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A message was
        brought into the council-chamber that a merchant from Gaul had
        something of importance to communicate to the Emperor. The man was
        admitted, after having been first searched by way of precaution. His
        dress was sober in cut and colour, and he had a small pack such as
        the wandering dealers in jewellery and similar light articles were
        accustomed to carry. Otherwise he was little like a trader; indeed,
        it did not need a very acute or practised hand to detect in him a
        soldier’s bearing, and even that of one who was accustomed to
        command.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He spoke in
        passable Latin, but with a decided accent, which, strongly marked as
        it was, was not recognized by any of those present. At the same time
        he produced from a silken purse, which he wore like a girdle round
        his waist, a small square of parchment. It was a letter written in a
        minute but very clear hand, and it had evidently been put for the
        security of the bearer, who could thus more easily dispose of it in
        case of need, into the smallest possible compass. This was handed to
        Constantine, who, in turn, passed it on to his elder son Constans, he
        being the only one present who could read and write with fluency. It
        ran thus:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A grim smile

        Rome!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The King will march into Italy and attack the Emperor in

        does it profit you to remain in this island, where nothing is to be

        which, wearied with oppression and desiring above all things to throw
        off the Roman yoke, will gladly welcome you. Your Cæsar shall reign
        on this side of the Alps and the Pyrenees. The future may bring other
        things, but that may suffice for the present.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The plan, so bold,
        and yet, it would seem, so feasible, and presenting a ready escape
        out of a situation that seemed hopeless, struck every one present
        with a delighted surprise. Even the phlegmatic Constantine was
        roused. <span class="tei tei-q">“It shall be done,”</span> he
        said.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some further
        conversation followed, which it is not necessary to relate. Ways and
        means were discussed. Questions were asked about the strength and
        temper of the forces in Gaul and Spain, about the feeling of the
        towns, and a hundred other matters, with all of which Atualphus
        showed a curiously intimate knowledge. When the Goth retired from the
        council, he left very little doubt or hesitation behind him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That afternoon a
        banquet, which was as handsomely set out as the very short notice
        permitted, was given to all the officers in the camp. When the tables
        were removed,<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href=

        Constantine, who had been carefully primed by his sons with what he
        was to say, addressed his guests. His words were few and to the
        point. <span class="tei tei-q">“Britain,”</span> he said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“has been long enough ruled by others. It is
        now time that she should begin herself to rule. It was the error of
        those who went before me to be content with the limits of this
        island. But here there is not enough to content us. Beyond the sea,
        separated from us by only a few hours’ journey, lie wealthy provinces
        which wait for our coming. A kindlier sky, more fertile fields,
        richer and fairer cities than ours are there. We have only to show
        ourselves, in short, to be both <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page84">[pg 84]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>welcomed and obeyed. Half the victories which we
        have won here to no profit over poverty-stricken barbarians would
        have sufficed to give us riches even beyond our desires. Henceforth
        let us use our arms where they may win something for us beyond empty
        honour and wounds. Follow me, and within a year you shall be masters
        both of Gaul and Spain.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The younger guests
        received this oration with shouts of applause; visions of promotion
        and prize-money, and even of the spoil of some of the wealthy cities
        of the mainland floated before them. The older men did not show this
        enthusiasm. Many of them were attached to Britain by ties that they
        were very loth to break. They had little to hope, but much to fear,
        from a change. Still, they saw the necessity for doing something;
        another year such as that which had just passed would thoroughly
        demoralize the army of Britain. Legions that get into the habit of
        making emperors and killing them for their pastime must be dealt with
        by vigorous remedies, and the easiest and best of these was active
        service. In any case it would have been impolitic to show dissent.
        Many feigned, therefore, a joy which they did not feel, and shouted
        approval when the Senior Tribune exclaimed, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Comrades, drink to our chief, Constantine Augustus,
        Emperor of Britain and the West.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The revel was kept
        up late into the night, the young Goth distinguishing himself by the
        marvellous depth <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg
        85]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
        his draughts and the equally marvellous strength of his head.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Emperor
        retired early from the scene, and Constans, who had little liking for
        these boisterous scenes, followed his example, as did most of the
        older men. One of these, the cheery centurion, who has been mentioned
        more than once, we may follow to his home.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Outside the camp
        had grown up a village of considerable size, though it consisted for
        the most part of humble dwellings. There were two or three taverns,
        or rather drinking-shops, where the soldiers could carouse on the
        thin, sour wine of the British vineyards, or, if the length of their
        purses permitted, on metheglin, a more potent drink, made from the
        fermentation of honey. A Jew, driven by the restless speculation of
        his race, had established himself in a shop where he sold cheap
        ornaments to the soldiers’ wives, and advanced money to their
        husbands on the security of their pay. A tailor displayed tunics and
        cloaks, and a shoemaker sold boots warranted to resist the cold and
        wet of the island climate. There were a few cottages occupied by the
        grooms and stablemen who attended to the horses employed in the camp,
        by fishermen who plied their trade in the neighbouring waters, and
        other persons of a variety of miscellaneous employments in one way or
        other connected with the camp. But just outside the main <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page86">[pg 86]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>street, at the end nearest to the camp,
        stood a house of somewhat greater pretensions. It was indeed a humble
        imitation of the Roman villa, being built round three sides of an
        irregular square, which was itself occupied by a grass plot and a few
        flower beds. It was to this that the Centurion Decius bent his steps
        after the conversation related in the last chapter. It was evidently
        with the reluctant step of the bearer of bad news that he proceeded
        on his way. As soon as he entered the enclosure his approach was
        observed from within. Two blooming girls, whose ages may have been
        seventeen and fifteen respectively, ran gaily to meet him. A woman
        some twenty-five years older, but still youthful of aspect and
        handsome, followed at a more sober pace.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What is the matter, father?”</span> cried the elder of
        the girls, who had been quick to perceive that all was not right.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The centurion held
        up his hand and made a signal for silence. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hush,”</span> he said; <span class="tei tei-q">“I have
        something to tell you, but it must not be here. Let us go
        indoors.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Shall the children leave us alone?”</span> said the
        centurion’s wife, who had now come up.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No,”</span> he answered, wearily, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“let them be with us while they can,”</span> he added in
        a low voice, which only the wife’s ears, made keenly alive by
        affection and fear, could catch.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gaiety of the
        young people was quenched, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page87">[pg
        87]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for,
        without having any idea of what had happened, they could see plainly
        enough that something was disturbing their parents; and it was with
        fast beating hearts that they waited for his explanation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Our happy days here are over, my dearest,”</span> said
        the centurion, drawing his wife to him, and tenderly kissing her, as
        soon as they were within doors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You mean,”</span> said she, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that the order has come.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> he answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“we
        are to leave as soon as the transports can be collected. The
        resolution was made to-day and will be announced to the army
        to-morrow. It is no secret, I suppose, or will not be for <a name=
        "corr087" id="corr087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=
        "tei tei-corr">long.</span>”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And where are we to go?”</span> cried the elder of the
        girls, whose face brightened as the thought of seeing a little more
        of the world, of a home in one of the cities of Gaul, possibly in
        Rome itself, flitted across her mind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The poor centurion
        changed colour. The girl’s question brought up the difficulty which
        he knew had to be faced, but which he would gladly have put off as
        long as he could.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We shall go to Gaul, certainly; where I cannot
        say,”</span> he answered, after a long pause, and in a hesitating
        voice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, how delightful!”</span> cried the girl; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“exactly the thing that Lucia and I have been longing
        for. And Rome? Surely we shall go to Rome, father? <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page88">[pg 88]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Are you not glad to hear it, mother? I am
        sure that we are all tired of this cold, foggy place.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mother said
        nothing. If she did not exactly see the whole of the situation, she
        had at least an housewife’s horror of a move. The poor father moved
        uneasily upon his chair.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The legion will go,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“but your mother and you——”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, Lucius,”</span> cried the poor wife, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“you do not, cannot mean that we are not to go with
        you!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nothing is settled,”</span> he replied, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“it is true; but I am much troubled about it.
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">You</span></span> might go, though I do not like
        the idea of your following the camp; but these dear girls—and yet
        they cannot be separated from you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The unhappy wife
        saw the truth only too clearly. If the times had been quiet, she
        might herself have possibly accompanied the legion in its march
        southward; but even then she could not have taken her daughters with
        her, her daughters whom she never allowed to go within the precincts
        of the camp, except on the one day, the Emperor’s birthday, when all
        the officers’ families were expected to be present at the ceremony of
        saluting the Imperial likeness. And this had of late been omitted
        when it was difficult to say from day to day what Emperor the troops
        acknowledged. The centurion had spoken only too truly; the legion
        might go, but they must <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page89">[pg
        89]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>stay
        behind. She covered her face with her hands and wept.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Lucia,”</span> cried the elder girl to her sister,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“we will enlist; we will take the oath; I
        should make just as good a soldier as many of the Briton lads they
        are filling up the cohorts with now; though you, I must allow, are a
        little too small,”</span> she added, ruefully, as she looked at her
        sister’s plump little figure, too hopelessly feminine ever to admit
        the possibility of a disguise. <span class="tei tei-q">“Cheer up,
        mother,”</span> she went on, <span class="tei tei-q">“we shall find a
        way out of the difficulty somehow.”</span> And she threw her arms
        round the weeping woman, and kissed her repeatedly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was silence
        for a few minutes, broken at last by the timid, hesitating voice of
        the younger girl.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But must you go, father?”</span> she said. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Surely they don’t keep soldiers in the camp for ever.
        And have you not served long enough? You were in the legion, I have
        heard you say, before even Maria was born.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My child,”</span> said the centurion, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“it is true that my time is at least on the point of
        being finished. Yet I can’t leave the service just now. Just because
        I am the oldest officer the Legate counts on me, and I can’t desert
        him. It would be almost as bad as asking for one’s discharge on the
        eve of a battle. And besides, though I don’t like troubling your
        young spirits with such matters, I cannot afford it. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page90">[pg 90]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Were I to resign now I should get no
        pension, or next to none. But in a year or two’s time, when things
        are settled down, I hope to get something worth having—some post,
        perhaps, that would give me a chance of making a home for
        you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A fifth person,
        who had hitherto taken no part in the conversation, and whose
        presence in the room had been almost forgotten by every one, now
        broke in, with a voice which startled the hearers by its unusual
        clearness and precision. Lena, mother of the centurion’s wife, had
        nearly completed her eightieth year. Commonly, she sat in the chimney
        corner, unheeding, to all appearances, of the life that went on about
        her, and dozing away the day. In her prime, and even down to old age,
        she had been a woman of remarkable activity, ruling her daughter’s
        household as despotically as in former days she had ruled her own.
        Then a sudden and severe illness had prostrated her, and she had
        seemed to shrink at once into feebleness and helplessness of mind and
        body. Her daughter and granddaughters tended her carefully and
        lovingly; but she seemed scarcely to take any notice of them. The
        only thing that ever seemed to rouse her attention was the sight of
        her son-in-law when he chanced to enter the chamber without
        disarming. The shine of the steel brought a fire again into her dim,
        sunken eyes. It was probably this that had now roused her; and her
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page91">[pg 91]</span><a name="Pg091"
        id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>attention, once awakened, had
        been kept alive by what she heard.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And at whose bidding are you going?”</span> she said, in
        a startlingly clear voice to come from one so feeble; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“this Honorius, as he calls himself, a feeble creature
        who has never drawn a sword in his life! Now, if it had been his
        father! He was a man to obey. He did deserve to be called Emperor. I
        saw him forty years ago—just after you were born, daughter—when he
        came with his father. A splendid young fellow he was; and one who
        would have his own way, too! How he gave those turbulent Greeks at
        Thessalonica their deserts! Fifteen thousand of them!<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh! mother,”</span> cried her daughter, horrified to see
        the old woman’s ferocity, softened, she had hoped, by age and

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The family

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The resolution to
        leave Britain was announced at a general meeting of the soldiers on
        the following day, and was received by it with tremendous enthusiasm.
        To most who were present, Gaul seemed a land of promise. It was from
        Gaul that almost every article of luxury that they either had or
        wished to have was imported, and some of the necessities of life, as
        notably wine, were known to be both better and cheaper there than in
        Britain. Comfortable quarters in wealthy cities, which were ready to
        be friendly, or could easily be brought to reason if they were not;
        easy campaigns, not against naked Picts, but against civilized
        enemies who had something to lose; and when the time of service was
        over, a snug little farm, with corn land, pasture, and vineyard, and
        a hard-working native to till it—such were the dreams which floated
        through the soldiers’ minds; and they were ready to go anywhere with
        the man <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page95">[pg 95]</span><a name=
        "Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>who promised to make
        them into realities. Older and more prudent men who knew that there
        were two sides to the question, and the unadventurous, who were well
        content to stay where they were, could not resist the tide of popular
        feeling, and concealed, if they did not abandon, their doubts and
        scruples. As money was scarce, the men volunteered to forego their
        pay till it could be returned to them with large interest in the
        shape of prize-money. They even gave up to the melting pot the silver
        ornaments from their arms and from the trappings of their horses. The
        messengers who were sent with the tidings of the proposed movement to
        the other camps—which were now mainly to be found in the southern
        part of the island—found the troops everywhere well disposed, and
        within a few days every military station was alive with the stir and
        bustle of preparations for a move.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the most
        pressing cares of the new leaders of the army was the securing the
        means of transport. There was a great number of merchant ships,
        indeed, which could be pressed into the service, and which would
        perform it very well if only the passage in the Channel could be made
        without meeting opposition. The question to be considered was whether
        they could reckon upon this, or would the fleet, which was still
        supposed to acknowledge the authority of Honorius, prevent them from
        crossing. The chief person to be reckoned with in this matter was, of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page96">[pg 96]</span><a name="Pg096"
        id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>course, the Count of the Shore,
        and a despatch was immediately sent to him. It was the production of
        Constans, and ran thus—</p>

        such forces as it may be necessary to use for this purpose to the
        land of Gaul. I call upon you therefore, having full confidence in
        your loyalty, to give me such assistance as may be in your power, for
        the accomplishment of this end, and promise you, on the other hand,
        my favour and protection. Farewell.</span></span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count received
        this communication about ten days after his arrival at the villa. The
        writer would scarcely have been pleased at the comments which he made
        as he read it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Constantine, Emperor.’</span>

        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Of Britain and the West.’</span> And I doubt
        whether he can call a foot of ground his own fifty miles from the
        camp. <span class="tei tei-q">‘To deliver other provinces from
        oppression and violence.’</span> Why not begin by trying his hand at

        excellent a judge in the matter. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Such
        assistance as may be in my power.’</span> Well, I should be glad to
        see the last of this crew of adventurers and villains; but he sha’n’t
        have my ships.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count’s
        position indeed was one of singular difficulty. He had thought it
        best—indeed he had found it necessary, if he was to do his own
        work—to keep on friendly terms with the usurpers who had gone before
        Constantine. It had been quite hopeless for him to attempt to coerce
        the legions. If they chose to make Emperors for themselves, he must
        let them do it, so long as they did not interfere with his liberty as
        a loyal subject. But this was a different matter. Crossing over into
        Gaul meant downright hostility to the authorities in Italy. How could
        he help it forward? And yet how could he prevent it? He had three
        ships available. All the others were laid up for the winter in
        harbours on the eastern and south-eastern shores of the island. With
        these he might do some damage to the legions in their passage; but
        the passage he could not hope to prevent. And if he did prevent it,
        what would be his own future relations with the army? Clearly he
        could not stay in Vectis, or indeed anywhere in Britain, for there
        was no place which he could hope to hold against a small detachment
        of the army. And to go, though it could easily be done, and would
        save him a vast <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page98">[pg
        98]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>amount of trouble, would be to give up his whole
        work, and to leave the unhappy inhabitants of the coast without
        protection from the pirates of the East. After long and anxious
        deliberation, which he did not disdain to share with his daughter and
        Carna, he resolved on a middle course, by following which he would
        neither help nor hinder. The first thing was to seek an interview
        with Constantine or his representatives, and a messenger was
        accordingly despatched suggesting a conference to be held on
        shipboard, under a flag of truce, off the mouth of the Great
        Harbour.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The proposition
        was accepted, and three days afterwards the conference was held, in
        the way that the Count had suggested. Each party brought a single
        ship, which was anchored for the greater convenience of carrying on
        the conversation, but was perfectly ready to slip its anchor in case
        of any threatening of treachery. The Count’s vessel had the Imperial
        standard at its mast-head; Constantine’s, on the other hand, had no
        distinguishing characteristic. Both he and his two sons were present,
        but the father was as silent as usual, and the chief spokesman was
        Julian.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count was very
        brief in his greetings, and indicated, as plainly as he could without
        saying it in so many words, that he did not acknowledge the
        pretensions of the usurper.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My lord,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“you
        have asked me to help in the transport of your army across the
        Channel. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page99">[pg 99]</span><a name=
        "Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Briefly then I have not
        the means. I have but three ships ready for sea, and not one of these
        can I spare.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Emperor can command their services,”</span> said
        Julian.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have received no instructions from my master,”</span>
        returned the Count, <span class="tei tei-q">“to use them except for
        the protection of the coast.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You have them now,”</span> said Julian, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and you will refuse to obey them at your
        peril.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My commission is made out by Flavius Honorius Augustus,
        and I know no other to whom I can yield obedience.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A pause followed
        this plain speech; the party on board with Constantine debated the
        situation with some heat, Julian maintaining that the Count must be
        brought to reason, the others being anxious to keep on good terms
        with him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A single cohort can bring him to order,”</span> cried
        the young Prince.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Can drive him out of the villa doubtless,”</span> said
        the more prudent Constans, <span class="tei tei-q">“but not bring us
        an inch nearer getting the ships.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We may at least count on your friendship,”</span> said
        Constans, Julian retiring sulkily from the negotiations; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“you will not hinder the passage.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have nothing to do with the disposition of the
        legions,”</span> answered the Count, <span class="tei tei-q">“and, as
        I said <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name=
        "Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>before, have no
        instructions except to defend the shore against the
        Pirates.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“His Majesty will not be ungrateful,”</span> said
        Constans.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I owe no duty but to Honorius, and desire no favour but
        from him,”</span> was the Count’s reply, and the conference was at an
        end.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The result was as
        favourable as Constantine could have expected. At least no opposition
        would be offered. Preparations for the passage were accordingly
        hurried on with all possible speed. All the towns along the coast
        were put under requisition for all the shipping that they could
        furnish, and, for the most part, were glad enough to answer the call.
        Whatever might happen in the future, it would be at least something
        to be rid of such troublesome neighbours. If other legions were to
        come, they might be more orderly and well-behaved. If these were to
        be the last, perhaps this would be a change for the better. Every one
        accordingly exerted himself to the utmost to supply the demand for
        transports.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a curious
        medley of vessels that assembled in the Great Harbour in the late
        autumn for the embarkation of the army. Old ships of war that had
        lain high and dry from before the memory of man were hastily pitched
        over and launched. Merchant vessels of every kind were there, from
        the huge hulks <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg
        101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that
        were accustomed to carry heavy cargoes of metal from Cornwall, to the
        light barks that carried on the trade in wine, olive oil, fruit, and
        such light goods between Armorica and Britain; even the fishing
        vessels from the villages along the coast were pressed into the
        service, and laden to the full, sometimes even to a dangerous depth,
        with military material and all the miscellaneous property with which
        an army of twenty thousand men would be likely to be encumbered. The
        greater part of this force had been collected at the Camp of the
        Great Harbour, which indeed was overflowing, and more than
        overflowing, with troops. But the garrisons that were situated to the
        eastward, as at Regnum<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href=
        "#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> and
        Anderida,<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href=
        "#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> were to
        join the fleet as it sailed, while those from the inland and coast
        stations of South and Eastern Britain were to make the best of their
        way to the Portus Lemanus. This was to be the rendezvous for the
        whole force, and the point for commencing the passage. The longer
        voyage, direct from the Great Harbour to the mouth of the Sequana
        (the Seine) or the projecting peninsula, now known as Manche, was
        dreaded, for the Channel had even a worse reputation in those days
        than it has now. It was arranged, accordingly, that the flotilla
        should sail along the coast as far as the Portus Lemanus, and cross
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102"
        id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>from thence to Bononia.<a id=
        "noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> The
        first half of November had passed before the preparations for
        departure were completed, and there were some who advised Constantine
        to delay his passage till the following spring. That he knew to be
        impossible; it was better to run any risk of storm or shipwreck than
        to face the winter with an ill-paid and discontented army.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At early dawn, on
        the fifteenth of the month, the embarkation began, the munitions of
        war, stores, and other baggage having been already, as far as was
        possible, put on board of the heavier transports. The water-gate of
        the camp was thrown open, and at this Constantine, his sons, and his
        principal officers took their place. The priest who served the church
        within the camp offered a few prayers, and solemnly blessed the eagle
        of the Second Legion, which constituted, as has been said, the main
        part of the forces in the camp. When this ceremony was concluded,
        Constantine addressed the army.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“By this gate in the days of our ancestors Vespasian led
        forth the Second Legion, then, as now, one of the chief ornaments and
        supports of the Empire, to execute the judgment of God on the

        reward the Empire of Rome. By this gate I lead you forth, worthy
        successors as you are of those <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        honourable, and certain to receive no less distinguished a reward.
        Let my name, which recommended me to your favour, and this place,
        already famous as the starting-point of victorious armies, be
        accepted as omens of success. Comrades, follow me on a march which
        has for its end nothing less than the Capitol of Rome.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He then took his
        seat in a boat manned with a picked crew, and, amidst shouts of
        applause from the assembled soldiers and spectators, was rowed to the
        ship, one of the few war galleys of recent construction that were to
        be found in the fleet. Then began the embarkation of the troops.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a singular
        scene. The news had spread with the greatest rapidity through the
        whole countryside, and the native population had crowded to witness
        the departure. Every point from which the sight could be seen was
        occupied by spectators. Even the slopes of Portsdown were thickly
        dotted by them. Nearer the camp the emotion and excitement were
        intense. A regiment that marches out of a town in which it has been
        in garrison for a year or two leaves many sad hearts behind it; even
        so brief a space is long enough for the binding of many ties. But the
        legions had been almost permanent residents in Britain, and they were
        bound to its people by bonds many and close. And this people was not,
        it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name=
        "Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>must be remembered, the
        self-restrained English race, so chary of sighs and groans, and so
        much ashamed of tears, but a race of excitable Celts, always ready to
        express all, and even more, than they felt. Wives, children,
        kinsfolk, friends were now to be left behind, and probably left for
        ever—for who could believe that the legions, whose departure had been
        threatened so long, could ever come back?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><a name="fig104"

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The embarkation
        went on. Some of the lighters could be brought close to the shore,
        and were boarded by gangways. To others of heavier burden the men had
        to be carried in boats. A strong guard had been posted to keep the
        place of embarkation clear. But the guard was powerless, or perhaps
        unwilling—for who could deal harshly with women and children so
        situated?—to check the rush of the excited crowd. Some of the women
        threw themselves on their departing husbands and lovers, clasped them
        round their necks, or hung to their knees. Others sat on the shore
        rocking themselves to and fro, or frozen by the extremity of their
        grief into stillness; some uttered shrill cries; others were sunk in
        a speechless despair. Nor were there wanting scenes of a less
        harrowing kind. Not a few of the departing soldiers were breaking
        other obligations besides those of the heart. Creditors were to be
        seen clinging to debtors whom they saw vanishing out of their sight.
        The Jew trader from the village outside the camp <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>seemed to be in despair. Probably he had
        secured himself fairly well against the consequences of an event
        which he must have been shrewd enough to foresee; but to judge from
        the bitterness and frequency of his appeals he was hopelessly ruined.
        He swore by the patriarchs and prophets that he had always carried on
        his business at a loss, and that if his debts were not now settled in
        full he should be reduced to beggary. The tavern-keepers were also
        busy, running to and fro, getting, or trying to get, payment of
        scores from customers whom they had trusted. There were others who
        had something to sell, some provisions for the voyage, a cloak, or a
        mantle, and offered it as a bargain—not, however, without a margin of
        profit—to dear friends with whom they were not likely to have
        dealings again. Other noisy claimants for attention were young
        Britons who wanted to enlist. For days past these had been flocking
        into the camp, and now that their last chance was about to disappear,
        they became importunate in the extreme. The numbers of the legions
        could have been almost doubled from these candidates for service.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Slowly, as ship
        after ship received its complement of men, the turmoil on the shore
        lessened, and about sunset the embarkation was completed. The weather
        was beautifully calm, a light wind blowing from the land during the
        day, and even this falling as the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>light declined. When the moon rose—the time of
        the full had been chosen for the embarkation—the sea was almost calm.
        Then, amidst a great cry of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Farewell,”</span> from the shore, the fleet slowly moved
        down the harbour. All night, making the most of the favourable
        weather, it pursued its way along the coast, being joined as it went
        by other detachments. At the Portus Lemanus it found the fleet which
        carried the garrisons of the eastern stations ready to start, and the
        whole made its way without hindrance across the Channel to Bononia,
        having as prosperous a voyage as had the legions which more than four
        hundred and fifty years before Cæsar had brought to the island.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The winter that
        followed the departure of the legions was a busy time with the Count.
        He was now almost the only representative of Roman power in Southern
        Britain, and the villa on the island became a place of considerable
        importance. A military force of some strength was gathered there.
        Constantine’s enterprise was not universally popular, and many had
        taken any chance that offered itself of escaping from it. Some had
        reached, or very nearly reached, the end of their time of service,
        and claimed their discharge; others were known to be loyal to Rome,
        and were allowed to retire. Not a few of those who found themselves
        without home or employment, and did not happen to have friends or
        kinsfolk in Britain, rallied to the Count. The families, too, of some
        that had gone with the legions were glad to claim such shelter and
        protection as the neighbourhood of the villa could give. Among these
        were the wife and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg
        108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>daughters of the Centurion Decius; the old
        mother had steadily refused to accompany them, and, with an aged
        dependent of nearly the same age, continued to occupy the house near
        the deserted camp. It was an anxious matter with the Count what was
        to be done with these helpless people. While things were quiet they
        could live safely, if not very comfortably, in the neighbouring
        village; but if trouble were to come—and there were several quarters
        from which it might come—they would have to be sheltered somewhere in
        the villa. This never could be made into a really strong place; but
        it might serve well enough for a time and against ordinary attack.
        Some of the outbuildings and domestic offices were fortified as well
        as the position admitted; such material of war as could be got was
        accumulated, and provisions also were stored. The most reliable
        resource, however, was in the ships of war. These were not, as was
        usual, drawn up on the beach for the winter, but were kept at anchor,
        ready for immediate use.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor were these
        precautions unnecessary, for indeed, as we shall see, mischief of a
        very formidable kind was brewing, and indeed had been brewing ever
        since the departure of the legions, and even before that event. And
        it was mischief of a kind of which it may safely be affirmed that
        neither the Count nor any Roman official, had any notion. Britain, to
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109"
        id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>all appearance, had for many
        generations been thoroughly subdued. Any Roman, if he had been told
        that there was any danger of rebellion among the Britons, would have
        laughed the suggestion to scorn. The legions, indeed, had often been
        mutinous and turbulent, and their generals ambitious and
        unscrupulous. The island indeed had gained so bad a reputation for
        loyalty to the Empire that it had been called the mother of tyrants,
        by <span class="tei tei-q">“tyrant”</span> being meant <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“usurper.”</span> But whenever Rome had been defied, she
        had been defied by her own troops. The Britons had enlisted in the
        rebel armies, but they had never attempted to assert anything like
        British independence. And yet the tradition of independence and
        liberty had always been kept alive. The Celtic race is singularly
        tenacious of such ideas, and also singularly skilful in concealing
        them from those who are its masters for the time, and the Britons
        were Celts of the purest blood. Caradoc<a id="noteref_33" name=
        "noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> and
        Boadicea, and other heroes and heroines of British independence, were
        household words in many families which were yet thoroughly Roman in
        spirit and manners. Just as the Christianized Jews of Spain, though
        to all appearances devout worshippers at church, still clung in
        secret to the rites of their own worship, so these loyal subjects of
        the Empire, as all the world <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>believed them, cherished in their hearts the
        memory of the free Britain of the past and the hope of a free Britain
        in the future. And the time was now at hand when their leaders
        thought that this hope might be fulfilled.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Shanklin Chine
        of to-day is not a little different from the Shanklin Chine of
        fifteen hundred years ago. It has, so to speak, been subdued and
        civilized. Now it is a very pretty and pleasant wood; then it was an
        almost impenetrable thicket, a noted lair of elk and wild boar.
        Inaccessible, however, as it seemed to any one who surveyed it from
        above, there was for those who were in the secret a way of
        approaching its recesses. A little path, the beginning of which it
        was almost impossible to discover without a guide, led up from the
        sea-end of the ravine to a hut which had been constructed about half
        way up the ascent. It consisted of a single chamber, about fourteen
        feet long, ten broad, and not more than seven in height, and was
        constructed of roughly-hewn logs, the interstices of which were
        filled with clay. The walls, however, were not visible, for they were
        covered with hangings of a dark blue material, something like serge.
        The floor was strewn with rushes. In the centre of the apartment
        there was a hearth, having over it an aperture in the roof, not,
        however, opening directly into the outer air, by which the smoke
        might escape. On this hearth two or <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>three logs were smouldering with a dull heat
        which it would have been easy to fan into flame. There were two
        windows unglazed, but closed with rough wooden lattices.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On three settles,
        roughly but strongly made of oak, which, with a rudely-polished slab
        of wood that served for table, constituted all the furniture of the
        hut, sat three confederates, and behind each stood a stalwart
        attendant armed with a wicker shield which hung from his neck, and a
        long Gallic sword. The three chiefs were curiously different in
        appearance. One, as far, at least, as dress and manner were
        concerned, might have passed anywhere for a genuine Roman. He was
        taller, it is true, than the Romans commonly were; and his
        complexion, though dark rather than fair, had a ruddier hue than was
        often seen under the more glowing skin of Italy; still he might have
        walked down the Sacred Way or the Saburra<a id="noteref_34" name=
        "noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a>
        unnoticed save as an exceptionally handsome man, of that fair beauty
        which the southern nations especially admire. His hair was carefully
        curled and perfumed; his face as carefully shaven, and showing no
        trace of beard, moustache, or whisker. His <a name="corr111" id=
        "corr111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=
        "tei tei-corr">toga</span> of brilliant white, his long-sleeved tunic
        of some dark purple stuff, his elegant sandals, were all such as a
        dandy of the Palatine <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg
        112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>might have worn. The one thing which would have
        been singular in a Roman street was the under-garment reaching to his
        knees, which he had assumed in consideration of the cold and wet of
        the insular climate. His fingers were loaded with rings, one of them
        a sapphire of unusual size, on which was engraved a likeness of the
        feeble features of the Emperor Honorius; on his left wrist might be
        seen a bracelet of gold.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If Martianus—for
        that was the name of the personage whom we have been describing—might
        have been easily mistaken for a Roman, the chief who sat facing him
        on the opposite side of the hearth was as manifestly a Briton. His
        hair fell over his shoulders in long natural curls which suggested no
        suspicion of the barber’s or the perfumer’s art. His upper lip was
        covered with a moustache which drooped to his chin. His body was
        covered with a sleeveless coat skilfully made of otters’ skins. Both
        arms were bare, and were plentifully painted with woad. On his legs
        he wore a garment something like the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“trews”</span> or short trowsers which the Highland
        regiments sometimes wear in lieu of the kilt; his feet were enveloped
        in rude boots of hide which were laced round his ankles. His
        ornaments were a massive chain of twisted gold, which he wore round
        his neck, and a single ring, rudely wrought of British gold, in which
        was set a British pearl of immense size but indifferent <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hue. He had a Roman name, as he could on
        occasion wear Roman costume, and speak the Latin tongue. In the
        present company he was known and addressed by his native name of
        Ambiorix.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The third
        conspirator had the appearance of a middle-class provincial. He wore
        the tunic that formed part of a Roman’s ordinary dress, but not the
        toga, which was replaced by a garment somewhat resembling a short
        cloak. But under the garb of a well-to-do townsman was concealed a
        very remarkable career and character. Carausius—for this was the name
        by which he was generally known—was one of the last representatives
        of the ancient Druid priesthood. The glory and power of this
        remarkable caste, which had once held itself superior to the kings of
        Britain, were departed. Indeed, it was almost dangerous to hold the
        ancient faith, and practise the ancient worship. Since the
        publication of the edict by which Constantine had made Christianity
        the Imperial religion, the adherents of the old religion had become
        fewer and feebler. Some of the chiefs and nobles still held it in
        secret, or were, at least, ready to return to it, if it should ever
        again become powerful; but its adherents were mostly to be found
        among the poorer classes. Even these in the towns were, in name at
        least, mostly Christians; it was only the dwellers in the remoter and
        wilder parts of the country that remained faithful. But these
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114"
        id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>scattered adherents revered the
        name of Carausius, who was believed to possess all the wisdom of his
        class, and was indeed credited with mysterious powers over nature and
        the gift of prophecy. From the Roman population all this was a
        secret, and the secret was remarkably well kept. Carausius was
        supposed to be nothing more than an ordinary farmer. His Roman
        neighbours would have been astonished in the last degree if they
        could have seen him presiding at one of the Druid ceremonies, in his
        white robes curiously embroidered with mystic figures, his chaplet of
        golden oak-leaves, and the headless spear, which was to him what the
        crozier was to a Christian bishop.</p>

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“There are some
        who have not sold their birthright for the delights of the bath and
        the banquet, and who are too proud to ape the manners of their

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Peace, my son,”</span> interposed the aged priest;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Martianus is not the less able to help the
        cause of our country because he seems to be the friend of those who
        oppress it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“These are but the wild words of youth, father,”</span>
        said Martianus. <span class="tei tei-q">“By a wise man they are
        forgotten as soon as they are heard. But let us hear what Ambiorix
        has to tell us about the force which we can bring into the
        field.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young chief
        entered into details which it is impossible to reproduce.
        Preparations had been made over nearly the whole of Britain, though
        the more northerly parts, owing to the perpetual attacks of their
        neighbours the Picts, had little to contribute in the way of help.
        Ambiorix knew how many men could be relied upon in every district; he
        was acquainted with the disposition of the representatives of the
        chief British families; he knew what each would want for himself, to
        whom he would be prepared to yield precedence, from whom he would
        claim precedence for himself. All his views and calculations were
        those of a sanguine temper; but he certainly could show—on paper at
        least, as we should say—a very respectable amount of strength. When
        he had finished his account of the resources <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>of Britain, Martianus, who, whatever his faults,
        had at least a genuine admiration for ability, held out his hand—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This is wonderful!”</span> he said. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You have a true genius for rule. That you should keep
        the threads of so complicated a business all so distinct is simply
        wonderful. You certainly give me hopes that I never had
        before.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I never doubted for a moment,”</span> returned the young
        man, <span class="tei tei-q">“but that when this Roman incubus was
        removed all would go well. Besides, who is there to attack us? We
        have no enemies.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No enemies!”</span> replied the other, in a tone of
        surprise. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you forget the Saxons by sea
        and the Picts by land.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I believe that neither will trouble us. They are not our
        enemies, but the enemies of Rome. They have harassed—they were quite
        right in harassing—the oppressors of the world: they will respect, I
        am sure, the liberties of a free people. When Britain is as
        independent as they are we shall be friends.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Martianus could
        not help smiling sarcastically. <span class="tei tei-q">“That is very
        fine. One would think that you had been a pupil in one of the schools
        of rhetoric which you so much despise. The most famous of our
        declaimers could not have put it better. But I am afraid that there
        will be some difficulty in explaining all this to
        them.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg
        118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In any case, we can defend ourselves,”</span> returned
        the young chief, <span class="tei tei-q">“though I do not think that
        the need will occur.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let us hope not,”</span> said Martianus, but his tone
        was not confident or cheerful.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There were, it may
        easily be supposed, not a few other subjects for discussion, and the
        conversation lasted for a long time, the young chief showing
        throughout such a mastery of details as greatly impressed his
        companions. When he had finished a brief silence followed. It was
        broken by the priest. There was a special solemnity in his tone,
        which seemed to claim an authority for his utterances, quite
        different from the position that he had taken up while politics or
        military matters were being discussed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My children,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“this is a grave matter. The weal or woe of Britain for
        many generations is at stake. If we fail, we may well be undone for
        ever. You cannot enter on so great an enterprise without the favour
        of the gods, and the favour of the gods is not easily to be won. For
        many years they have lacked the sacrifice which they most prize. I
        myself, though I have completed my threescore years and ten, have but
        once only been privileged so to honour them. The time has come for
        this sacrifice to be offered once more. Have I your consent, my
        children? But indeed I need not ask. This is a <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>matter in which I cannot be mistaken, and
        from which I cannot go back.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young chief
        nodded assent, but said nothing. He was evidently disturbed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What do you mean, father?”</span> he said.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The sacrifice which the gods most prize,”</span>
        answered the old man, <span class="tei tei-q">“is also that which is
        most prized by men. The most perfect offering which we can present to
        them is the most perfect creature they themselves have made. Sheep
        and oxen may suffice for common needs; but at such a time as this,
        when Britain itself is at stake, we must appease the gods with the
        blood of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">Man</span></span>.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Martianus grew
        pale. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not possible,”</span> he
        stammered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Not only possible, but necessary,”</span> calmly
        returned the priest. <span class="tei tei-q">“Our fathers were
        commonly content to offer those who had offended against the laws;
        but in times of special necessity they chose the noblest victims.
        Even our kings have given up their sons and their daughters. So it
        must be now.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this was
        absolutely horrible to Martianus. He did not believe indeed in
        Christianity, but it had influenced him as it had influenced all the
        world. Whether he was at heart much the better may be doubted. But he
        was softer, more refined; he shrank from visible horrors, from open
        cruelty—though he could be cruelly selfish on occasion—and from
        blood<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name=
        "Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shed, though he would
        not stretch out a finger to save a neighbour’s life. And what the
        priest said was as new and unexpected to him as it was hideous. He
        had no idea that this savage faith had survived in Britain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Father,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“such a
        thing would ruin us. Such a deed would raise the whole country
        against us. A human sacrifice! It is monstrous!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You are right so far,”</span> returned the priest,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the country must not know it. Britain is
        utterly corrupted by this new faith, a superstition fit only for
        women, and children, and slaves; and I don’t doubt but that it would
        lift up its hands in horror at this holy solemnity. But there is no
        need that it should know it. It must be done secretly—so much I
        concede.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And the victim?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, the days are passed when a Druid could lay his
        command on Britain’s noblest, and be obeyed without a murmur. The
        victim must be taken by force, and secretly.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And have you any such victim in your
        thoughts?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The priest
        hesitated for a moment; but it was only for a moment. He resumed in a
        low voice, which it evidently cost him an effort to keep steady—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have not forgotten the necessity of a choice; indeed
        for months past it has been without ceasing in my mind, and now the
        choice is made. The victim <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg
        121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>whom
        the gods should have is a maiden, beautiful and pure. She is of noble
        descent, though her father was compelled, by poverty and the
        oppression of the Roman tyrants, to follow a humble occupation. Thus
        she is worthy to be offered. And yet no true Briton will regret her
        fate, for she has deserted the faith of her ancestors for the base
        superstition of the Cross.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And her name, father?”</span> said both of the
        conspirators together.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again the priest
        hesitated; a close observer might even have seen a trace of agitation
        in that stern countenance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is Carna,”</span> he said, after a pause, which
        raised the suspense of his hearers almost to agony. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is Carna, adopted daughter of Count
        Ælius.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And he looked
        steadfastly at his companions’ faces, as if he would have said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I dare you to challenge my
        decision.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two started
        simultaneously to their feet. Not long before, young Ambiorix, who
        was then not yet possessed by the fanatical patriotism which now
        mastered him, had admired her beauty and sweetness of manner, and had
        had day-dreams of her as the goddess of his own hearth. Then a
        stronger love had come in the place of the old. It was not of woman,
        but of Britain free among the nations, as she had been before the
        restless eagles of the South <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>had found her, that he thought day and night.
        Still, he could not calmly hear her doomed to a horrible death, and
        for a moment he was ready to rebel against the sentence of the
        priest.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The older man was
        terribly agitated. He had been for many years on the friendliest
        footing with the Count, a frequent guest at his table, almost an
        intimate of the house. And Carna was an especial favourite with him.
        Her sweetness, her simplicity, and a pathetic resemblance that she
        bore to a dead daughter of his own, touched him on the best side of
        his nature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Priest,”</span> he thundered, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“it shall not be. I would sooner the whole scheme came to
        ruin; I would sooner die. A curse on your hideous
        worship!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The priest had now
        crushed down the risings of human feelings which his training had not
        sufficed to eradicate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You have sworn by the gods,”</span> he said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and you cannot go back. If you do not
        hesitate to betray Britain, at least you will not dare to betray
        yourself. You know the power I can command. Go back from your promise
        to follow my leading, and you are a dead man. You are
        faithful?”</span> he went on, turning to Ambiorix. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You do not draw back?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young chief
        returned a muttered assent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The older man,
        meanwhile, was in a miserable condition of indecision and terror.
        Unbeliever as he was, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg
        123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>having long since given up the faith of his
        fathers, and never accepted the doctrine of the church but with the
        emptiest formality, he had not put from his breast the superstitious
        fear that commonly lingers when belief is gone. And he knew that the
        priest’s threatened vengeance on himself was no empty boast. The
        strength of Druidism had passed, but it still had fanatics at its
        command, whose daggers would find their way sooner or later to his
        heart. The cold, cynical look with which he had entered on the
        conference had given place to mingled looks of rage, remorse, and
        fear.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You must have your own way,”</span> he muttered,
        sullenly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My son,”</span> said the priest, in a tone which he made
        studiously cautious, <span class="tei tei-q">“what is one life in
        comparison with the happiness and glory of our nation? You, I know,
        would shrink from no sacrifice, and, believe me,”</span> he added in
        a lower voice, for he had to play off the two rivals against each
        other, <span class="tei tei-q">“believe me, whatever sacrifice you
        make shall not miss its reward.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carna was known
        all over the neighbourhood of the villa as the best and kindest of
        nurses, always ready to help in cases of sickness, and able to
        command the services of the household physician where her own medical
        skill was at fault. It was therefore with no surprise that the
        morning after the consultation, recorded in the last chapter, she was
        told that her help was wanted in a case of urgent need. The woman who
        had brought the message was a stranger. She was the daughter, she
        said, of an old woman living at Uricum, a small hamlet about four
        miles from the villa. She had happened to come the day before on a
        visit to her mother, and found her very ill; they had no medicines in
        the house, and indeed should not have known how to use them if they
        had. Would the lady come, and, if she thought proper, bring the
        physician with her? The place <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>mentioned was on the limits of the district with
        which Carna was acquainted. It could only be approached by a path
        through the forest; and the girl had not visited it more than two or
        three times in her life. She had a vague remembrance, however, of the
        patient’s name. On sending for the physician, it was found that he
        was out, having been called away, Carna was told, to a case which, he
        had said before starting, would probably occupy him for the greater
        part of the day. On hearing this, she made up her mind to start
        without waiting for him. The illness was very probably of a simple
        kind, though it might be violent in degree. Very likely it was a case
        in which the nurse would be more wanted than the doctor. She provided
        herself with two or three simple remedies which she learnt to employ
        in the ordinary maladies of the country, of which feverish colds were
        the most common, and started, taking with her as companion and
        protector a stately Milesian dog, or mastiff, who was always
        delighted to play the part of a guard in her country walks. Her own
        pet dog, a long-haired little creature, something of the Spanish
        kind, whom she had intended to leave at home, contrived to free
        himself from the custody to which he had been assigned, and
        stealthily followed her, cunningly keeping out of sight till the
        party had gone too far for him to be conveniently sent back. He then
        showed himself <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg
        126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with
        extravagant gestures of contrition, was tenderly reproached,
        pardoned, and allowed to go on.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the walk
        the messenger was curiously silent, and answered all Carna’s
        questions about her mother and her affairs in the very briefest
        fashion. All that could be got from her was that she lived on the
        main land, about twenty miles inland, in a northerly direction, and
        that since her marriage, now twenty years ago, she had seen very
        little of her mother. When they reached the outskirts of the hamlet
        she pointed out her mother’s house, and, making an excuse that she
        had an errand for a neighbour, disappeared. Carna, seeing nothing but
        a certain surliness of temper, possibly only shyness, in her
        companion, went on without suspicion. She reached the house, and
        knocked at the door. There was no answer. She knocked again. Still
        all was silence. Looking a little more closely at the place she could
        see no signs of habitation, no smoke, for instance, making its way
        out of the thatch (for chimneys did not yet exist, at least, in the
        poorer dwellings). The next thing was to peep in at the window, a
        wooden lattice, which had been left partially open. The room into
        which she looked was perfectly bare.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A suspicion rushed
        into her mind that she had been tricked, and that danger of some
        unknown kind was at hand. The strange sympathy which often
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127"
        id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>makes the dog so quick to
        understand the feelings of man, made the big mastiff, Malcho, uneasy.
        With a low growl, showing uneasiness rather than fear or anger, he
        ranged himself at her side.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As she stood
        considering what was next to be done, a party of six men, one of whom
        led a horse, issued from the wood which bordered the little garden of
        the cottage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Can you tell me where I shall find one Utta, who, I am
        told, is sick, and wishful to see me? Can it be that I have mistaken
        the house?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Utta, my lady,”</span> said one of the party,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“is not to be found any more. She died a week
        since.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But,”</span> said Carna, with rising anger, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“a woman, who said that she was her daughter, told me,
        not more than two hours ago, that she was sick, and desired to see
        me. Why have I been brought here for nothing?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pardon me, lady,”</span> returned the first speaker, in
        a tone in which respect and command were curiously blended,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“but you have not been brought for nothing.
        You have a better work to do than ministering to a sick old
        woman.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he spoke he
        moved forwards. But he had not taken two steps before the great dog,
        who had been watching the speakers, we might say almost listening to
        their talk with the most eager attention, sprang furiously at him,
        and laid him prostrate on the ground. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>His companions rushed to rescue their leader
        from the dog and to seize the girl. They did not accomplish either of
        their objects with impunity. The gallant creature turned from one
        assailant to another with a strength and a fury which made him a most
        formidable antagonist, and he had inflicted some frightful wounds
        before he was made senseless by repeated blows from the weapons of
        the assailants. Nor was Carna overpowered without a struggle. Weapons
        she had none, except a little dagger, meant for use in needlework,
        which hung at her side; but she used this not without effect. She
        clenched her fist, and dealt two or three blows, of which her
        antagonists bore the marks upon their faces for days to come. Finally
        she wrenched herself from the grasp of the assailants as a last
        resource, and endeavoured to fly, but it was a hopeless effort.
        Before she had run more than a few yards she was overtaken. Her
        captors used no more violence than they could help. Probably had they
        been less unwilling to hurt her, she could not have resisted so long.
        Finding her so strong and so determined, they were obliged to bind
        her hands and feet; but they did this with all the gentleness
        compatible with an evident resolve to make her bonds secure. In the
        midst of her terror and distress Carna could not help observing with
        astonishment that the cords which they used were of silk. Then
        finding herself absolutely helpless, she said—</p><span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Do not bind me as though I were a slave. On the faith of
        a Christian, I will not attempt to escape.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Lady, we trust you,”</span> said the leader of the
        party, and at the same time directed one of his companions to unbind
        the ropes. <span class="tei tei-q">“Be comforted,”</span> he went on;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“we do not intend you harm; on the contrary,
        high honour is in store for you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carna was scarcely
        reassured by these mysterious words, but she had now recovered her
        calmness. Summoning up all her courage—and it was far beyond even the
        average of a singularly fearless race—she intimated to her captors
        that she was ready to follow them without further delay. They mounted
        her upon the horse, which, as has been said, one of them was holding,
        and started in a northerly direction. Two of the party had been so
        severely injured by the hound, that they were obliged to stay behind.
        One of the others held the bridle of the horse, and led him forward
        at an ambling pace; the others followed behind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The way of the
        party lay entirely along rough forest-paths which seemed from their
        appearance, often grown over as they were with branches and creepers,
        to be but seldom traversed. Night had fallen some hours before they
        reached the northern coast of the island. Their way had lain in a
        north-westerly direction, and they emerged near to the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>arm of the sea now known as Fishbourne
        Creek. Here they found a rowing boat in waiting.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carna’s captors
        now handed over their charge to the boat party, which was under the
        command of the young chief whom we know by the name of Ambiorix. He
        received his prisoner with a dignified civility, made her as
        comfortable as he could with rugs and wraps in the stern of the boat,
        and then gave orders to start. The journey across the channel, which
        we now know as the Solent, occupied some hours, though the night was
        calm, and the ebbing tide mostly in the rowers’ favour, the shortest
        route not being taken, but a north-westerly direction still followed.
        The morning was just beginning to break when the coast was reached
        near the spot where Lymington now stands. The party hurriedly
        disembarked, put the girl on a rough litter which they had with them
        in the boat, and carried her to a dwelling some half-mile inland, and
        surrounded by the woods which here almost touched high-water mark.
        Carna found a tolerable chamber allotted to her, where she was waited
        upon by an elderly woman who seemed bent on doing everything that she
        could for her comfort. The girl was of the elastic temper which soon
        recovers itself even under the most depressing circumstances. She had
        the wisdom, too, to feel that, if she was to help herself, she must
        keep up her strength to the very best of her power. She <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>did not refuse the simple but well-cooked
        meal which her attendant served to her, after she had enjoyed the
        refreshment of a bath. And then overpowered by the fatigue of a
        journey which had lasted not much less than twenty-four hours, she
        sank into a deep sleep.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was dark when
        her attendant gently roused her and told her that in an hour she
        would be required to resume her journey, in which, as Carna heard
        with some pleasure, she was herself to be her companion. A start was
        made about three hours before midnight, and the journey was continued
        till an hour before dawn. This plan was followed till their
        destination was reached. The party was evidently careful to keep its
        movements secret. Their way lay as before, by woodland paths, leading
        them through the district now known as the New Forest. They travelled
        but slowly, more slowly indeed than they had done on the island, for
        the paths were still rougher, and, in fact, almost undistinguishable.
        Carna, too, was the only one of the company that had a horse, and her
        female attendant, who was neither young nor active, could manage but
        a few miles at a time. It was the morning of the second day after
        they had left the coast before they reached the edge of the great
        forest known as the Natanleah. Some five miles to the west lay
        Sorbiodunum, now Salisbury. This was a Roman town of some
        impor<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name=
        "Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tance, and had of
        course to be avoided by the party, who, indeed, were anxious, as
        Carna could gather from a few scattered words that were let drop in
        her presence, as to the way in which the rest of their journey was to
        be accomplished. The country was open, cultivated, and comparatively
        populous, the inhabitants being, for the most part, thoroughly
        Latinized. Two Roman roads, too, had to be crossed before their
        destination was reached.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day was spent
        as usual in concealment and repose. An hour after nightfall the party
        started. They had now managed to procure another horse for Carna’s
        attendant; and as the ground was fairly level, unenclosed, and, at
        that time of year, unencumbered by crops, they moved rapidly onwards.
        The moon had now risen, and Carna, for the first time, could at least
        see where they were going. She was still, however, at a loss to know
        what part of the country they had reached. At midnight a halt was
        called, and the leader of the party proceeded to blindfold the
        captive’s eyes. But if he wanted to keep her in ignorance of the
        locality, he was a little too late. The girl’s quick sight had caught
        a glimpse in the distance of the huge circle of earth walls, now
        known as Amesbury. She had never seen the place, but it was known to
        her in the chronicles of her people. There, as she had read with a
        patriotism which all her Roman surroundings had not been <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>able to quench, her countrymen had more
        than once held at bay the legions of Rome. She knew roughly the
        situation of the famous camp of the Belgæ, and she was sure that
        these massive fortifications, just seen for a moment in the
        moonlight, could be none others than those of which she had read so
        often.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the bandage
        was removed, she found herself in a chamber larger and more
        comfortably furnished than any she had hitherto occupied on her
        journey. Part of the palace of one of the old kings of the Belgæ was
        still standing, and the travellers had taken up their quarters in it.
        The Amesbury camp was indeed as safe a place as they could have
        chosen. It was a spot which no Roman, much less a Briton living under
        Roman protection, would care to visit. The whole countryside believed
        that it was haunted by the spirits of the great chiefs and warriors
        who had been buried within its precincts, and of the slaves who had
        been killed to furnish them with service and attendance in the unseen
        world. The scanty remnant who still clung to the Druid faith found
        their account in encouraging these superstitions. More than one
        appearance had been arranged to terrify sceptical or curious persons
        who had been rash enough to visit the vast circle of embankments. For
        many years before the time of our story the enclosure had been
        untrodden except by the few who were in the secret of the Druid
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134"
        id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>initiation. Here, then, the
        party waited securely with their prisoner till the time should come
        for the solemn visit to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was some time
        before the prolonged absence of Carna caused any alarm at the villa.
        When she was on one of her errands of kindness among the sick, it was
        difficult to say when she would return. But in the course of the
        afternoon the old physician returned, not a little wrath that he had
        been sent on a fool’s errand. He had been told that an old farmer,
        living close to the north-west of the island some seven or eight
        miles from the villa was lying dangerously ill, and he had found the
        supposed patient in vigorous health, and not a little angry at being
        supposed to be anything else. This seemed to make things look
        somewhat serious. It was easy to guess that the trick played upon the
        physician had something to do with the message brought to Carna. It
        was remembered that the stranger had asked that he should accompany
        the girl; it was at least possible that she knew him to be out of the
        way, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name=
        "Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and that she would not
        have made the request had she not known it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the Count,
        who had just returned from an inspection of his crews, was talking
        the matter over with his daughter and two of his officers who
        happened to be present, a new cause for suspicion and alarm presented
        itself. Carna’s pet dog had found its way back with a bit of broken
        cord round its neck, and refused to be comforted, tearing and pulling
        at the dresses of the attendant, and saying, as plainly as a dog
        could say it, that there was something wrong, that it must be
        attended to at once, and that he would show them how to do it, if
        they would only follow him. When the rope round his neck was examined
        more closely, it was found that it had been gnawed in two.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“He has been tied up and has broken
        away,”</span> said the Count, when this was pointed out to him.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And if I know the dear little thing,”</span>
        broke in Ælia, <span class="tei tei-q">“he would not have left his
        mistress as long as he could be near her. I am sure that some
        mischief has happened to her.”</span> And this was the general
        impression, though, who could have ventured on so audacious an
        outrage it was impossible to guess.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What had happened,
        as the reader may possibly guess, was this. The dog had remained with
        Carna, showing his love, not by fierce resistance like that made by
        his powerful companion, for which he had <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the sagacity to know he had not sufficient
        strength, but by keeping as close to her as he could. After she had
        been made a prisoner, and while the party were preparing for a start,
        he had been tied to a tree. It had been intended that he should go
        with his mistress, for whom, as has been said, her captors showed
        throughout a certain consideration, but it so happened that in the
        bustle of departure he was forgotten. When he saw her go and found
        himself left behind, he set himself with all his might to gnaw the
        rope which fastened him to the tree. This task took him a long time,
        for he was an old dog, and his teeth were not as good as they had
        been. Finding himself free he started in headlong pursuit, easily
        tracking the party by the scent, but after a while he halted; a happy
        thought—is it possible that, in the teeth of all accumulated
        evidences, any one can deny that dogs can think?—a happy <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">thought</span></span>
        then struck his mind, quickened to its utmost capacity of
        intelligence by love and grief. We may translate it into human
        language thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“If I follow her and overtake
        her, what good can I do? but if I go back and make the people at home
        understand that something has happened to her, then I can help her to
        some purpose.”</span> This was his conclusion, anyhow. How he arrived
        at it only He knows who makes all things great and small, and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“divideth to all severally as He
        will.”</span> He turned back, ran with breathless <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>speed to the villa, and did all that could
        be done, short of speaking, to show that his dear mistress was in
        trouble.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile,
        however, much time had been lost, and the day was already far
        advanced. Anxious as was the Count to set out, he could not but
        perceive that haste might defeat the object of his journey. To start
        when the light was failing would probably be to miss important signs
        of what had happened, and, very possibly, to risk success. All
        preparations, however, were made. The men who were to form the
        pursuing party were chosen. As it may be supposed, there was no lack
        of volunteers. There was not a single being at the villa or its
        dependencies that would not have given a great deal and borne a great
        deal to see Carna again in safety. But it would be possible to take
        only a small number, if the pursuit was to be rapid and effective.
        Some of the most active of the crews of the war-ships accordingly
        were chosen, sailors having then as now a cheerful activity that
        makes them particularly valuable members of a land expedition. The
        Count added others from his own establishment, and he determined to
        conduct the party himself. It was arranged that it should start the
        following day, as soon as it should be sufficiently light.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the slaves
        who was early astir on the following morning found fixed to an
        outside gate of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg

        villa a document, rudely written and roughly folded, which bore the

        We have long been weakening our hold upon the province, and we had
        better clear out altogether, if we cannot do better than this. But I
        suppose we have no choice. We must not endanger the dear girl’s life.
        But now the question is about the money. I do not think that I have
        so much in gold in the house; but we can borrow somewhere what is

        summoned to consult with him, <span class="tei tei-q">“the peddler
        can help you. He has the reputation of being richer than he
        looks.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> replied the Count, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that would be a simple way out of the difficulty, if it
        can be managed. Meanwhile, let me see what I have got of my own at
        hand.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was found that
        eighty gold pieces were forthcoming, and the peddler was summoned and
        asked whether he could make up the balance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My Lord,”</span> said the man when he was brought into
        the Count’s presence and had heard the story, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I will make no idle pretence of poverty. I have what you
        want, and it is entirely at your lordship’s service. But will you let
        me see the letter in which this demand for ransom is
        made?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count handed
        him the document, and he examined it long and carefully.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My lord,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        more I look at this, the more I am confirmed in certain suspicions
        which have been growing up in my mind. I have been thinking of this
        matter, and of other matters which seem to me to be connected with it
        all the night. It will take long to explain, and, of course, after
        all I may be wrong; still, I think you would do well to hear what I
        have got to say.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count, who had
        previously had reasons for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg
        141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>thinking well of the peddler’s intelligence,
        bade him proceed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In the first place,”</span> continued the man,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I think this letter is a blind. It is made
        to look like the work of some very rude and ignorant person. But the
        pretence is not well kept up. You will see, if you look at the
        handwriting a little more closely, that it is feigned. The writer was
        perfectly able to make it a great deal better than it is, if he had
        so chosen, and he has sometimes forgotten his part. Some of the
        letters, some even of the words, particularly of the small words,
        about which he would naturally be less careful, are quite
        well-formed. Now a really bad writer, I mean one who writes badly
        because he does not know how to write well, is always bad; every
        letter he forms is misshapen.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count examined
        the document and acknowledged that this comment upon it was just. And
        he began to see too what was naturally more apparent to him, as an
        educated man, than it was to the peddler, that the style was hardly
        what would have been expected from an ignorant scribe.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What, then, is your conclusion?”</span> he asked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“About that,”</span> returned the other, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am not so certain. That this is a blind, as I said, I
        am sure; and this talk about the ransom consequently is a deception.
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Three days,’</span> you see it says. That
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142"
        id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>would be three days lost. No,
        my lord, it is not by robbers that this has been planned.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What then?”</span> cried the Count, flushing a fiery red
        as a sudden thought occurred to him. <span class="tei tei-q">“Carna
        is very beautiful. Do you think——”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said the peddler, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        think not. A lover would not lay so elaborate a plot as I fancy I can
        see here. I think the Lady Carna is a hostage, or——”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He paused, and
        continued after a few minutes of silence. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        have much to piece together, and it would take long, and lose much
        precious time. That is the last thing that we should do. They have
        got too much start already. We must not let them improve it more than
        we can help. You will let me go with you, and I shall have leisure to
        put all I have got to say together without hindering you. But the
        sooner we are on their track the better.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this the Count
        readily agreed, and preparations for immediate departure were made.
        It was with difficulty that Ælia could be persuaded that she must be
        left behind. But when it was pointed out to her that her presence
        must inevitably make the progress of the party more slow, and
        increase their anxieties, she reluctantly gave way. At the last
        moment an unexpected addition was made to the party in the person of
        the Saxon prisoner.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My lord,”</span> said the peddler, to whom the young
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143"
        id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>man had communicated his
        earnest desire to be allowed to go; <span class="tei tei-q">“it may
        seem a strange thing for me to say, but you cannot have a better
        helper in this matter than this young fellow. He is as strong as any
        horse, and as keen and intelligent a youth as I ever saw. And in this
        case too his wits will be doubly sharp, and his arm doubly strong,
        for he worships the very ground that the Lady Carna treads
        upon.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Very well,”</span> replied the Count, with a smile,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“let him go. After all, it is quite as safe
        to take a lion about with one, as to leave him at home.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pet dog was,
        of course, a valued member of the expedition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The task of
        tracing the lost girl was at first easy enough. She and the stranger,
        who, it now seemed, had been sent to entrap her, had been seen
        proceeding in the direction mentioned in the message. The
        neighbourhood of the villa was mostly cultivated ground, and there
        had been people at work in the fields who had noticed the girl’s
        well-known figure. Beyond this belt of cultivated country, which
        might have been about a mile broad, there was only one road which it
        was possible for her to have taken. Following this, and reaching the
        hamlet at the further end of which, as we have seen, the abduction
        had taken place, they still found themselves on the right track. A
        child had seen two people, one of them, she said, a pretty lady, pass
        by on the morning of the day before. The lady had smiled, and said a
        few words to her in her own language, and had given her a sweetmeat.
        Further on the traces of what they were looking for became still more
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145"
        id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>evident. There were marks of
        struggle on the ground, for Carna, as we have seen, had not suffered
        herself to be taken without resistance; a button was found on the
        ground, which the peddler at once identified as one of his own
        selling. And a little off the path, the tree was found to which the
        dog had been tied, with the fragment of string still attached to it.
        Curiously enough, no traces of the great dog could be found.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor did the next
        step in the pursuit delay them long. There were, it is true, three
        paths through the forest, which closed in the hamlet on every side
        except that by which the party had approached it. Carna’s pet dog at
        once decided for the searchers which of the three they should follow.
        He discovered the scent very quickly, ran at the top of his speed
        along the path thus distinguished from the others for about a hundred
        yards, and then, coming back, implored the party, so to speak, by his
        gestures, that they should come with him. It was evident that the
        path had been traversed by a party of considerable size, whose
        tracks, the marks of a horse’s hoofs among them, were still fresh in
        the ground, soft as it was with the winter rains. The dog was
        evidently satisfied that they were right, for he ran quietly on, now
        and then giving a very soft little whine. It wanted still an hour or
        so of sunset when the party emerged out of the forest upon the
        shore.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg
        146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here it might have
        seemed at first all trace was lost. The tide had flowed and ebbed
        twice since the girl had been there, and had swept away all marks of
        footsteps. The dog too was no longer a guide. The poor little
        creature’s distress indeed was pitiful, as he ran to and fro upon the
        shore with a plaintive whine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count asked
        his companions for their opinions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Have they taken to the wood again, do you think? or have
        they crossed the water? they may have gone a mile or more along the
        shore and then entered the forest. In that case it seems hopeless to
        recover the track.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is my opinion,”</span> said the peddler, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that they have crossed to the mainland; but it is only
        an opinion, and I have little or nothing to urge for it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Other members of
        the party had different views; and, on the whole, opinion was adverse
        to the peddler’s view; and the Count was about to order a search in
        the direction of the wood further along the shore, when the attention
        of the party was arrested by a shout from the Saxon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The discussion had
        been carried on in a language which he had still some difficulty in
        understanding, and he had been pacing backwards and forwards along
        the shore, seemingly lost in thought, but really watching everything
        with that keen attention to all outward objects which is one of the
        characteristics <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg
        147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
        uncivilized man. It was thus that something caught his eye. He
        plunged his hand into one of the little rock-pools upon the shore,
        and drew it out. It was a small gold trinket, which the girl had
        dropped in the forlorn hope that it might be found. Its weight, for
        it was an almost solid piece of metal, had kept it in the place where
        it fell, and as the night and day had been uniformly calm, there had
        been no sufficient movement of the water to disturb it. With a cry of
        delight the Saxon held it up, and the Count recognized it at
        once.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah!”</span> said the peddler, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        knew the fellow would be of use to us. If the Lady Carna is anywhere
        on the earth he would find her. This proves, my lord, that they have
        crossed the sea. They would certainly have not come down so far from
        the shore as this.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This seemed too
        probable to admit of any doubt. Happily it had occurred to the Count
        that it would be well to have some kind of vessel at his command, and
        he had ordered a pinnace to start from the haven as soon as it could
        be got ready, and to coast along the shore of the island, watching
        for any signal that might be given. The land party had outstripped
        the ship, which, indeed, had not started till somewhat later. Still,
        it might be expected very soon. Meanwhile there was an opportunity
        for discussing the aspect which the affair now bore.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After various
        opinions had been given, the Count <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>turned to the peddler. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And what do you think of the affair?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have a notion,”</span> the man replied, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“but it may be only a fancy—still I seem to myself to
        have a notion of what their purpose is.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Do you mean,”</span> pursued the Count, as the other
        paused, and seemed almost unwilling to speak, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“do you mean that they think of holding her as a kind of
        hostage against me? Do they fancy that I shall not be able to act
        against them, and shall hinder my colleagues from acting, as long as
        she is in their power? or will they keep her as something to make
        terms about if they fail?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The other was
        still silent for a few minutes, and seemed to be collecting his
        thoughts. At last he said:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My lord, what I am going to tell you may seem as foolish
        as a dream. I should have gone on saying nothing about it, as I have
        said nothing about it hitherto, if things had not happened which
        makes it a crime for me to be silent any longer. You find it
        difficult to believe that a rebellion is possible among a nation
        which you have always looked upon as thoroughly subdued. But what
        will you say if I tell you that this rebellion has been preparing for
        generations, and that the Druids have been, and are, at the bottom of
        it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Druids!”</span> cried the Count, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I did not know <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg
        149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that
        there were any Druids. I thought that the last of them had
        disappeared years ago.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Not so,”</span> replied the peddler; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the people who rule do not know what is going on about
        them. Now I have been among this people the greater part of my life.
        I have seen them, not as they show themselves to you, but as they
        are. You think that they are Christians—not very good Christians,
        perhaps, but still not worse than other people—and believing the
        Creeds, if they believe anything. Now I know for a certainty that
        many of them are no more Christians now than their fathers were three
        hundred and fifty years ago. I have seen sometimes, when no one knew
        that I saw, what they really worshipped. I have pieced together many
        little things. I have heard hints dropped unawares, and I know that
        there is a secret society, which has existed ever since the island
        was conquered, which has for its object the bringing back of the old
        faith. I could name—if things turn out as I expect they will, I will
        name—men whom you believe to be quiet, respectable citizens, but who
        are the heads of a conspiracy reaching all over Britain, against Rome
        and the Christian Church. You never see them except in the tunic and
        the cap, but they can wear on occasion the Druid’s robe and
        crown.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But tell me,”</span> said the Count, with a certain
        impatience, <span class="tei tei-q">“what has this got to do with my
        daughter?”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg
        150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This, my lord,”</span> answered the other, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that if the Druids are making the great effort for which
        they have been preparing for no one knows how many years, they will
        begin it with all the solemnity that is possible—in a word, with the
        great sacrifice. This, I suppose, has not been practised for many
        generations, but it has not been forgotten. To speak plainly, I
        believe that the Lady Carna has been carried off for the
        victim.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count
        staggered back as if he had been struck. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Impossible!”</span> he cried. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Such things cannot be in Britain: and why should they
        fix upon her?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“For two reasons,”</span> said the peddler. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“She is of royal race. You very likely do not know or
        care about such things. All Britons to you will be much about the
        same; but they do not forget it. Yes, though her father was nothing
        more than a sailor, she is descended from Cassibelan. And then she is
        a Christian. These are the two reasons why they have chosen her—this
        is what they honour her for, and this is what they hate her
        for.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But where,”</span> cried the Count, <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That,”</span> replied the other, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I think I know. It can hardly be done anywhere but at
        the Great Temple, the Choir Gawr, as they call it
        themselves.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        north-west. Some eight miles beyond the western point of the island
        there is a river flowing into the sea, and a fishing village at the
        mouth. I know the place well, and have one or two good friends there.
        We shall get a guide there; I have in my mind the very man who will
        suit us well in that capacity. Indeed the river<a id="noteref_35"

        would be no bad guide. The Great Temple lies but a few miles westward
        from its upper course. The road will be easy too along the valley,
        which is mostly clear of wood.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then,”</span> said the Count, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the Temple cannot be far from Sorbiodunum. Why not make
        for the Great Harbour, and go by the Great Road to Venta<a id=

        travelling would be much easier.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have thought of that,”</span> said the other,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“but I think my plan the best. The distance
        is far less, and, what is quite as important, we shall not be
        expected to come that way. Depend upon it there will be an ambuscade
        laid somewhere along the road; for they will feel sure that we shall
        try and come that way.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was evident
        anyhow that as far as the sea voyage was concerned the man was right.
        The tide was ebbing slowly, and an east wind, already high and still
        rising, was blowing. To make way against wind and tide to the Great
        Harbour would be in any case a laborious business; and if the wind
        increased to a gale as it threatened to do, might become impossible.
        The galley had been chosen for swiftness rather than seaworthy
        qualities in rough weather, and might fail in the attempt to work
        back. On the other hand both wind and tide thoroughly favoured a
        westward voyage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Indeed she moved
        gaily on with a strong breeze, that in the phraseology of to-day
        would be called a half-gale, blowing due aft, and scarcely felt the
        heavy <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name=
        "Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sea, seeming to leave
        the waves behind, as the rowers bent their backs to their work. The
        Saxon had now taken his place on one of the thwarts, and his gigantic
        strength, put it was evident with a will into the labour, seemed of
        itself to drive the galley forwards. In an incredibly short time the
        river mouth was reached, the galley stranded, and the guide, who, by
        great good luck, had just returned from a fishing voyage,
        engaged.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But now an
        unforeseen obstacle opposed itself. A few specks of rain had been
        felt by the party as they went, and then as the day went on, began to
        change to snow. And now the wind almost suddenly died away, and at
        the same time the fall of snow grew heavier. The face of the guide
        fell.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My lord,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        hear that your business is urgent and cannot wait. But I must tell
        you that the weather looks very bad, and that the prospects of our
        journey are almost as unfavourable as they can be. We shall have a
        very heavy fall of snow, and if the wind gets up again, and it begins
        to drift, we shall be blocked, and possibly unable to get either
        backwards or forwards.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We must go,”</span> said the Count, in a determined
        voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“though the snow were over our
        heads.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a very short
        interval allowed for refreshment, the party started. At first the
        snow was no very serious obstacle; but after a couple of hours
        inces<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name=
        "Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sant and rapid fall, it
        began to make movement very difficult. The progress of the travellers
        grew slower and slower, and the Count began to calculate that at
        their present rate of speed they could but barely arrive in time. It
        was an immense relief when the sky almost suddenly cleared, and
        showed the moon still evidently somewhat short of the full. But the
        relief was only temporary. The clearer weather was the result of a
        change of wind, which had suddenly veered to a point westward of
        north and which was rapidly increasing in force. And now occurred the
        thing which the peddler’s knowledge of the country and the weather
        had suggested to him—the snow began to drift. At first the party was
        hardly conscious of the change; indeed for a time the way was
        somewhat clearer and easier than before; then as they came to a
        slight depression, the snow was felt to be certainly deeper. Still
        three or four miles were traversed without any particular difficulty.
        Then the leader of the party suddenly plunged into a drift
        considerably above his knees. This obstacle, however, was surmounted,
        or rather avoided by making a <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">détour</span></span>.
        But still the wind rose higher and higher, and as it rose, not only
        did its force hinder the party’s advance, but the drifts grew now
        formidably deep. Some of the party began to lag behind; the Count
        himself, who was past his prime, began to acknowledge to himself,
        with an agony of anger and fear in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>his heart, that his strength was failing. Still
        they struggled on, leaving one or two of the strugglers to make the
        best of their way back, or, it might well be, to perish in the snow,
        till about half the distance was traversed. They had now reached a
        little hamlet,<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href=
        "#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> on the
        outskirts of which there happened to be a small villa. It was shut
        up, the proprietor chancing to be absent, but it was put at the
        disposal of the party by the person who was in charge. Fires were
        hastily lighted, and the travellers, most of whom had almost reached
        the end of their powers of endurance, were refreshed with warmth and
        food.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count held a
        council of war. The situation indeed <a name="corr156" id="corr156"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">seemed</span>
        nothing less than desperate. Two out of the party of
        twenty-five—their numbers had been increased by a contingent taken
        from the crew of the galley—were missing. They had fallen out on the
        march, and it was too probable that they had perished in the snow. Of
        the remainder but four or five seemed fit for any further exertion.
        By far the freshest and most vigorous of them was the Saxon. The
        fatigues of the night had scarcely told on his gigantic strength. The
        Italians, and even the Britons, natives of the southern parts of the
        island, and little accustomed to heavy falls of snow, looked at him
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157"
        id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with astonishment. As for him,
        he was full of impatience at the delay.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count was in
        an agony of doubt and distress. His own strength had failed so
        completely that all his spirit—and there was no braver man in the
        armies of Rome—could not have dragged him a hundred yards further.
        And he saw that many of his followers were in little better case. And
        yet to give up the pursuit! to leave Carna, the sweetest, gentlest of
        women, dear to him as a daughter of his own, to this hideous death!
        The thought was too dreadful.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“When do they perform their horrible rites?”</span> said
        the Count to the peddler.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“When the full moon shines through the great south
        entrance of the Temple,”</span> was the answer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And when will that be?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“To-night, and about an hour before midnight, as far as I
        can guess.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And what must be done? What is your advice?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There seems to me only one thing possible. Those who can
        must press on. I count a <a name="corr157" id="corr157" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">great</span> deal on
        the Saxon. His strength and endurance are such as I never saw in any
        man, and they now seem to be increased manyfold. Anything that can be
        done by mortal man, he, you may be sure, will do. Our guide too has
        happily something still left in him; and there are three or four
        others who are equal to going on after they have had a little rest. I
        should say, let <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg
        158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>them
        get two or three hours’ sleep, and then push on to Sorbiodunum. That
        is not far from here, and they can easily reach it before noon
        to-day, after allowing a fair time for rest. Perhaps they may get
        some help there, though the place is not what it was. It is some
        years since I paid it a visit, and then I found it in a very
        declining condition, so much so that it was not worth my while to go
        there again. There were not more than two or three Roman traders
        there, and they made but a very poor living out of their
        business.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This seemed to be
        the best course practicable under the circumstances. The Saxon, with
        whom the peddler held a long conversation, was for pressing on at
        once, and would almost have gone alone, but for want of a guide. When
        he understood the state of the case he yielded to what he perceived
        to be a necessity, and throwing himself down on the hearth was almost
        immediately buried in a profound sleep, an example which was soon
        followed by the rest of the party, the Count and the peddler
        excepted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not more than two
        hours could be allowed for rest. The guide and the three sailors who
        had volunteered to go on were roused with no little difficulty; the
        young Saxon was wide awake in a moment. The party partook hastily of
        a meal of bread, meat, and hot wine and water, which the peddler had
        been busying himself in preparing while they slept, and, after
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159"
        id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>stowing away some provisions
        for the day, started on their journey about two hours before
        noon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sorbiodunum was
        reached without much difficulty. But there a great disappointment
        awaited them. The peddler’s anticipations were more than fulfilled,
        for the town was almost deserted. Only one Roman remained there. He
        was an old man who had married a British wife, and who cultivated a
        farm which had descended to her from her father. When the guide
        handed to him the letter which the Count had addressed to the
        authorities of the town, begging for any help which they could give
        in saving the liberty and life of a person very dear to himself, he
        shook his head. When he heard the whole of the guide’s story, he
        became still more depressed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Authorities!”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“there are no authorities. I am the only Roman left in
        the place, and I do not know where to look for a single man to help
        you. As for the Great Temple on the plain there is not a creature
        here who would dare to go near it. They think it haunted by spirits
        and demons. And indeed there <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">are</span></span> strange stories about it. To
        tell you the plain truth, I should not much care to go there myself.
        No; I see nothing to be done. But I will ask my wife. Perhaps her
        woman’s wit will help us.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bidding the party
        be seated, he left the room in which he had received them, and
        entered the kitchen, where his wife was busy with her domestic
        affairs.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg
        160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In about half an
        hour he returned. His expression was now a shade more cheerful than
        before.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah!”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I was
        right about the woman’s wit. She <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">has</span></span>
        thought of something. You must know that my wife is a very devout
        Christian—for myself I am a Christian too, but I must own that I
        don’t see so much in it as she does—and that she has brought up our
        children in that way of thinking. Now, our eldest son is a priest in
        a village some seven miles hence, and his people are devoted to him.
        If there is any one in this neighbourhood who can give you the help
        you want it is he. He has only got to say the word and his people
        will follow him to the end of the world. Here is a proof of it. Four
        years ago a strong party of Picts came this way, ravaging and
        plundering wherever they went. There were not more than fifty of
        them, but the people were as terrified as if they were so many
        demons. If you think this place a desert now, what would you have
        thought it then? There was not a single person left in it—at least a
        single person that could help himself—for the cowards had the
        meanness to leave some of the old and the sick behind them. But my
        son was not going to let the robbers have it all their own way—you
        know he has something of the Roman in him—and he went about talking
        to his people in such a way, that they plucked up spirit, and fell on
        the Picts one night when they were expecting nothing <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>less than an attack, and gave such an
        account of them, that the country has not been troubled since with
        the like of them. Well, as I say, he is the man to help you. I have
        my younger son here working with me on the farm; he is just such
        another as his elder brother, and would have been a priest too if he
        had not felt it to be his duty to stay and help me. I will bring him
        in, and he shall hear the whole story and carry it to his brother.
        That is the best hope that I can give you, and I really think that it
        is worth something. What I can do for you does not go beyond
        hospitality, but to that you are heartily welcome. You have some
        hours before you. If you start an hour after sunset you will be in
        ample time. And, in fact, you had better not start before, because
        the less that is seen of your movements the better. I don’t know that
        any of the people about here are infected with the Druid
        superstition, though I have had one or two hints to that effect,
        hints which what you have just told me helps to explain. But, in any
        case, the more secret you are the better. Besides, my son’s Party
        cannot reach the Great Temple till long after dark. Meanwhile take
        some rest and refreshment, for, believe me, you have something before
        you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This advice was so
        obviously right, that the guide, who was in command of the party, had
        no hesitation in accepting it.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About six o’clock
        another start was made. At first, though the weather looked
        threatening, no serious obstacle presented itself. The snow was
        somewhat deep on the ground, but there were no serious drifts on
        their way, a way which, indeed, for some distance from the town lay
        under the leeward side of a wood. But they had not gone more than a
        mile and a half when a disastrous change in their circumstances
        occurred. The wind rose almost suddenly to the height of a gale, and
        brought with it a fall of snow, separated by the rapid movement of
        the air into a very fine powder, and working its way through the
        clothing of the traveller with a penetrating power which nothing
        could resist. Still, benumbed as they were, almost blinded by the icy
        particles which were whirled with all the force of the tempest
        against their faces, they struggled on for more than half the
        distance which lay between them and their destination. Then the three
        sailors cried out simultaneously that they must halt, and the guide
        unwillingly owned that he must follow their example. Only the Saxon
        was left to go on, and he, with a gesture which it was impossible to
        mistake, declared his intention of persevering. Just at that moment
        the clouds parted in the east, and the full moon showed the landscape
        with a singular clearness, its most conspicuous feature being the
        gigantic stones of the Great Temple, which could be seen about two
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163"
        id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>miles to the northward. The
        guide pointed to them, and the Saxon, when they caught his eye, leapt
        forward with an energy which nothing seemed to have abated, and, with
        a gesture of farewell to his companions, plunged into the
        darkness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Great Temple,
        or Stonehenge as it is now called, though its decay had already
        commenced, still preserved the form which we have now some difficulty
        in tracing. There was an outer circle consisting of thirty huge
        triliths,<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href=
        "#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        greater part of which were still standing in the position in which
        the unsparing labour of a long past generation had placed them.
        Within this there was a circle of forty single stones, this circle
        again containing two ovals. One of these ovals was composed of five
        triliths, even larger than those which stood in the outer circle; the
        other was made of nineteen upright stones. At the upper end of this
        stood the altar, a low, flat structure of blue marble.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All the
        preparations for the sacrifice were complete when Cedric—for we may
        as well henceforth <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg

        the Saxon by the name which he bore among his countrymen—reached the
        spot. Carna was being led by two of the subordinate priests to the
        altar, where Caradoc stood, robed for the rite which he was about to
        perform. The sky had now again cleared, and the moon, riding high in
        the heavens, poured a flood of silver light through the south
        entrance, and fell on the priest’s impassive face as he stood
        fronting the light, while it glittered on his crown of gold and gave
        a dazzling brilliancy to his white robe. In his hand he held a knife
        of flint, with which it was the custom to give the first blow to the
        victim, though innovation had so far prevailed even in the Druid
        worship that the sacrifice was completed with a weapon of steel. But
        this latter lay at his feet, and was concealed by the fall of his
        robe. It was not, indeed, supposed to be used. The attendants, who
        were also dressed in white, were rough and brutal creatures, selected
        for their office because they could be trusted to carry out any
        orders without remonstrance or hesitation. Yet even they seemed
        touched by the girl’s dignity and courage, as she walked with head
        erect and unfaltering gait between them. Had she hesitated, or hung
        back, or struggled, doubtless they would not have hesitated to drag
        her to the altar; but walking as she did with a proud resignation to
        her fate, they showed her a rude respect by letting their hands rest
        as lightly as pos<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg
        166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>sible, so as to give no sense of constraint,
        upon her arms. On either side of the priest stood Martianus and
        Ambiorix. The younger man had braced himself to what, fanatical
        patriot as he was, was evidently a hateful task. He looked
        steadfastly and unflinchingly at the scene; but his face was deadly
        pale, and the blood trickled down his chin as he bit his lip in the
        unconscious effort to maintain a stern composure. Martianus was
        overwhelmed with shame and horror. If there was one softer heart
        among the <span class="tei tei-q">“stern, black-bearded kings”</span>
        who of old in Aulis watched the daughter of Agamemnon die, he must
        have looked and felt as Martianus did in the Great Temple that night.
        Cursing again and again in his heart the ambition which had led him
        to mix himself up with this fanatical crew, but too much a craven at
        heart to protest, he stood trembling with agitation, mostly keeping
        his eyes shut or fixed upon the earth, but sometimes compelled by a
        fascination which he could not resist to lift them, and take in the
        horror of the scene. Each of the chiefs had an armed attendant
        standing behind him. Besides these there were no spectators of the
        scene, though guards were disposed at each of the entrances which led
        to the central shrine. Even these had been kept in ignorance of what
        was to be done, and they were too deeply imbued with the traditional
        awe felt for the Great Temple to think of playing the spy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The priest, after
        observing the position of the moon, and seeing that the shadows fell
        now almost straight towards the north, began the invocation which was
        the preliminary of the sacrifice. It was for this that the Saxon was
        waiting, as he stood in the shadow of one of the huge triliths. He
        crept silently out of his concealment, entirely unobserved, so intent
        were all present on the scene that was being enacted. His first
        object was the priest. This had been laid down for him in the
        instructions given him by the peddler before he started; and indeed
        his own instinct would have dictated the act. The priest put out of
        the way, the sacrifice would, for the time at least, be stopped; for
        so high a solemnity could not be performed but by one of the very
        highest rank. Time would thus be gained, and with time anything might
        happen. One firm thrust between the shoulders sent the Saxon’s sword
        right through the priest’s body, so that the point stood out an inch
        or two from the priest. Without a cry the man fell forward, deluging
        with his blood the stone of sacrifice. The ministrants who stood on
        either side of Carna were paralysed with astonishment and dismay.
        Before they could recover themselves Cedric had dragged his weapon
        out of the priest’s body, sheathed it, and thrown himself on them.
        Two blows, delivered almost simultaneously by fists that had almost
        the force of sledge hammers, levelled them both senseless to
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168"
        id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the ground. He then caught the
        girl up in his arms. A full-grown woman—and Carna had a stature
        beyond the average of her sex—is no light burden, but Cedric’s
        strength was, as has been said before, exceptionally great, and now
        it seemed doubled by the fierce excitement of the hour. To escape
        with her by running was, he knew, impossible. For such a task no
        fleetness of foot, no strength, would be sufficient. To attempt would
        be to expose himself to certain death, and Carna to as certain
        re-capture. But his quick eye had caught sight of a place where he
        might hold out, at least for a time, against a much superior strength
        of assailants. One of the triliths had partially fallen, the huge
        cross-stone having been so displaced that it formed an angle with one
        of its supports, and so afforded a protection to the back and sides
        of a fighter who managed to ensconce himself in the niche, and who
        would so have only his front to protect. Setting Carna behind him,
        and making her understand by a movement of the hand that she must
        crouch as low as she could upon the ground, he prepared to hold his
        position. The odds against him were not so heavy as might have been
        supposed. The two ministrants were unarmed. Of the four left, the two
        chiefs and their attendants, one was a middle-aged man, who had never
        been expert in arms; and who, whatever his skill and strength, would
        scarcely have cared to use them in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>such a conflict. Ambiorix, indeed, was of
        another temper. The gloomy, fanatical doggedness with which he had
        looked on at the preparations for the sacrifice gave way to a fierce
        delight when he saw an enemy before him with whom he could cross
        swords. In his inmost soul he had hated the thought of the sacrifice;
        but yet the man who had hindered it, and with it the weal of Britain,
        was a foe whom it would be pleasure to smite to the ground. But
        fierce as was his temper, it was full of chivalry. He would not
        dishonour himself by bringing odds against an enemy. Signing to the
        armed attendants to stand back, he advanced to challenge Cedric. The
        Saxon, in height and strength, was more than a match for his
        antagonist. But he was hampered by his position, especially by the
        presence of the girl. The weapon, too, with which he was armed—a
        short Roman sword—was strange to him. He thought with regret of his
        own good steel, an heirloom come down to him from warriors of the
        past, and inscribed with magic Runic rhymes, that was then lying at
        the bottom of the Channel. The change, however, was not really so
        much to his disadvantage as he thought. The stones behind him would
        have hindered the long sweeping blow which made the great Saxon
        swords especially formidable. Altogether it might have seemed as if
        Cedric must inevitably be worsted in the struggle. The British chief,
        though he hated <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg
        170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        customs and even the civilization of the Roman conquerors, had not
        disdained to learn what they could teach him in the use of arms. They
        were acknowledged masters in that, and he accepted the maxim that it
        was right to be instructed even by one’s bitterest enemy. Accordingly
        he knew all that a fencing master could teach him; and all the
        Saxon’s agility, quickness of eye, and strength, could not
        counterbalance the advantage. Before many minutes had passed Cedric
        was bleeding from two wounds, neither of them very serious, but
        sufficient to hamper and weaken him. One had been inflicted on the
        sword-arm, and threatened to disable him altogether before long. He
        felt this himself, and took his resolve. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        curse of Thor upon this foolish toy!”</span> he cried, in his native
        tongue, as he threw the short sword straight in the face of his
        enemy; and followed up the strange missile by leaping on his
        antagonist, both of whose arms he fastened down to his sides with a
        supreme exertion of strength. Gigantic strength, indeed, was the only
        thing which gave so desperate a resort the chance of success, and
        this might well have failed, if the adversary had not been entirely
        unprepared for the movement. Once held in this tremendous clasp,
        Ambiorix was as helpless as a kid in the hug of a bear. Cedric fairly
        lifted him off his feet, and threw him backwards. His head struck one
        of the great stones <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg
        171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in
        his fall, and he lay senseless and helpless on the ground.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The struggle was
        over so quickly that the attendants had no time to interfere; nor
        when it was finished did they feel any great eagerness to engage so
        formidable a champion. Still they advanced, and Martianus, who felt
        himself unable to maintain any longer in the face of what had
        happened his attitude of inaction, advanced with them. By this time
        Carna, who had been almost stunned by the rapid succession of
        startling incidents, had recovered her self-possession. She lifted
        herself from the ground, and stepped between Cedric and the three
        antagonists who stood confronting him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Martianus,”</span> she cried, <span class=

        horrible doings—you, my father’s friend, you, a Christian
        man?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Briton stood
        silent, cursing in his heart the hideous enterprise which had not
        even the poor merit of success. He was spared the necessity of
        speaking by an exclamation from one of the ministrants.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“See!”</span> cried the man, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“there is a party coming. It is not likely that they are
        friends—let us be off.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And indeed the
        moonlight clearly showed a number of persons who were rapidly
        advancing up one of the great avenues.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Martianus did not
        hesitate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You are right,”</span> he said to the man, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“we must <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg
        172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>go.
        The priest’s body must be left. It is useless to cumber ourselves
        with the dead; we shall have as much as we can do to escape
        ourselves, but take the sacred things. They at least must not fall
        into the hands of the enemy. And you,”</span> he went on, addressing
        himself to the two attendants, <span class="tei tei-q">“take up your
        master and carry him off. We have something of a start, and it is
        possible that they may not pursue us.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His directions
        were at once obeyed. The priest’s body was stripped of its robes and
        ornaments. Ambiorix, who still lay unconscious on the ground, was
        carried by the united efforts of the soldiers and ministrants, and
        the whole party had started in the direction of Amesbury before the
        new-comers, who proved to be the priest Flavius, with a party of his
        people, reached the Temple.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The British
        priest’s home was at a populous village on the banks of the Avon, now
        known by the name of Netton, and as this was some miles nearer than
        Sorbiodunum, he determined to take thither the party whom his
        opportune arrival had rescued from danger. Once arrived there, it
        would be easy to send a messenger to the town, and await further
        instructions. A litter was hastily constructed for Carna, who, though
        her spirits and courage were still unbroken, was somewhat exhausted
        by excitement and fatigue. The Saxon’s wounds were dressed and bound
        up by the priest, who united some knowledge of medicine and surgery
        to his other accomplishments, and was indeed scarcely less well
        qualified for the cure of bodies than of souls. The priest-doctor
        looked somewhat grave when he saw how deep the sword-cuts were, and
        how much blood had been lost, but Cedric made light of his injuries,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174"
        id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>scorned the idea of being
        carried, and indeed seemed to find no difficulty in keeping close to
        Carna’s litter on the homeward journey.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Netton—we are
        unable to give the British name of the village—was reached some time
        before dawn. At sunrise the priest, who had refreshed himself with
        two or three hours’ sleep, was ready to perform his office at his
        little church. It was the first day of the week, and the building was
        crowded. It was an oblong building, with a semicircular eastern end,
        that resembled that kind of chancel which is known by the name of an
        apse. It had been designed by an Italian builder, who had copied the
        shape that seems to have been used in the earliest Christian
        buildings, that of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">schola</span></span>
        or meeting-house of the trade guilds or associations. The body of the
        building was of timber. The eastern end, or sanctuary, had a little
        more pretension to ornament; it was of stone, and the walls were hung
        with somewhat handsome tapestry, wrought with symbolic designs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Few of the party
        which had accompanied the priest the night before were prevented by
        their fatigue from being present. The Britons were always a devout
        people, and in Netton their priest had gained such an influence over
        them, that they were exceptionally regular in their religious duties.
        Carna had been anxious to attend the service, but <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the priest’s wife—he had followed the
        usual practice of the British Church in marrying before
        ordination—had absolutely forbidden so unreasonable an exertion.
        Cedric, who would otherwise have been present in whatever part of the
        building was open to an unbaptized person, was still buried in a
        profound slumber. The service was in Latin, a language of which most
        if not all the worshippers knew enough to be able to follow the
        prayers. Such portions of the Scriptures as were read were
        accompanied by the priest with occasional expositions in the British
        language; and the sermon, except the text, which was in Latin, and
        taken from the recently published Vulgate of St. Jerome, was wholly
        in that tongue. The preacher’s text was from the Psalms, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Quomodo dicitis animæ meæ, Transmigra in montem sicut
        passer?”</span><a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href=
        "#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a> and was
        mostly concerned with the troubles of the time. He had in an uncommon
        degree the national gift of eloquence, and stirred the hearts of his
        hearers to their inmost depths. He warned them that troublous times
        were approaching, such as neither they nor their fathers had seen
        were approaching, and that they would have to resist unto blood for
        the faith into which they had been baptized.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Antichrist,”</span> he cried, adapting to the day, as
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176"
        id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Christian preachers have done
        in every age, the language of the apostles—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Antichrist is at hand! You see him in these heathen
        hosts who are threatening you on every side; these Saxon pirates from
        the east, who are ravaging our shores; these Pictish ravagers from
        the north, who every year are penetrating further and further into
        the land. Yes,”</span> he added, with a telling reference to the
        event of the night before, <span class="tei tei-q">“and even in
        apostates of British blood, who have preserved in your midst the
        hideous superstitions from which our ancestors turned to worship the
        blessed Christ; and as it was in the days of the blessed Paul, so is
        it now: <span class="tei tei-q">‘He that letteth will let till he be
        taken out of the way,’</span> The Roman power has kept these forces
        in check, but it will keep them no more. The time is short. They are
        gathering every day in greater strength, and you must gird yourselves
        to meet them.”</span> Therefore, he went on, they must be strong and
        quit them like men. They must gird on them, and make complete in
        every point, their spiritual armour—the helmet of salvation, the
        sword of the Divine Word, the all-covering shield of faith; nor must
        they forget the temporal weapons with which the outward enemies who
        assail the body must be met. <span class="tei tei-q">“He that hath no
        sword, let him sell his garment and buy one,”</span> cried the
        preacher, in his final apostrophe to his people, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and he will find that as his day so shall his strength
        be, and that the Lord can <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg

        hundred, as by the eight hundred thousand men that drew sword in
        Israel.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wrought by the
        eloquence of the orator to an almost incontrollable excitement, the
        whole congregation sprang to their feet, as if they were asking to be
        led at once to the battle. Then, with a sudden change from the
        stirring tone of the trumpet to the sweet music of the flute, the
        preacher touched another note. In a pleading voice, almost but never
        quite broken with tears, he besought them to cleanse their hearts; he
        reminded them that the armies of the Lamb of God must be clothed in
        the white robe of righteousness; that purity, tenderness to the weak,
        charity to the fallen, were as needed for Christ’s soldiers as
        steadfastness and courage, till many a cheek was wet with tears of
        contrition and repentance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the course of
        the forenoon a fleet-footed messenger was despatched to Sorbiodunum.
        By the time he reached that town the Count and his party had arrived,
        excepting one who had been left behind, still too exhausted by his
        forced march to move. Some, too, had been sent back in the hope that
        they might not be too late to rescue the stragglers who had perforce
        been left behind during the journey through the snow. As there was
        now no immediate necessity of haste, Ælius allowed his followers to
        rest and refresh them<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg
        178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>selves for the remainder of the day at <a name=
        "corr178" id="corr178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=
        "tei tei-corr">Sorbiodunum.</span> The following morning he went on
        to Netton, where he found, to his great delight, that Carna had
        apparently suffered no harm from her perilous adventures. His
        gratitude to the Saxon was beyond the power of words to express.
        Though it somewhat hurt his Roman pride that a barbarian should ever
        have the strength to hold out when all others fail, he did not suffer
        his vexation to take anything from the hearty warmth of his thanks.
        Cedric received them with the courtesy of an equal, a bearing which
        both Britons and Italians could not help resenting in their hearts,
        while they reluctantly admired his surpassing strength.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three days were
        spent in Netton with much comfort to the party, the priest and his
        people showing them as liberal an hospitality as their means
        admitted, and refusing the recompense which the Count almost forced
        upon <a name="corr178a" id="corr178a" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">them.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Take something for your poor,”</span> said Ælius, when
        his arguments were exhausted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My people,”</span> answered the priest, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“must not lose one of the most precious privileges of
        their Christian life, the sweet compulsion of having to minister to
        the necessities of those who want their help.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then you cannot refuse some ornament for your
        church,”</span> the Count went on.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The good man
        hesitated for a moment. His <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg
        179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>church was dear to his heart, and he would
        gladly have seen it made as fair as art and wealth could make it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My lord,”</span> he replied, after his brief hesitation,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“in happier times, and in another place, I
        would not refuse your generous offer. But now the poorer we are the
        better. I should like to see our altar-vessels of gold, but it would
        not be well to tempt the barbarians to a deadly sin, and to expose
        Christian lives to worse peril than that they now stand in, by such
        treasures, of which the report could scarcely fail to be spread
        abroad. Our chalices, and flagons, and patens are now of lead, thinly
        covered for decency’s sake with silver, and they are of no value to
        any but those who use them. No, my lord, leave our church with at
        least such safety as poverty can give. But there are places in the
        world, I would fain believe, though indeed in these days I scarce
        know where they are, where Christian men worship God in security, and
        where the treasures of the church are safe from robbery. Let your
        gift be given there, when you find the occasion. And if you will let
        me know the place I shall be happy with imagining it, without the
        anxious care of its custody.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this answer
        the Count was compelled to be content, till at least next morning, by
        which time Carna’s ready wit had suggested that the priest could
        hardly refuse a gift of books.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My lord,”</span> said the good man, when the Count
        renewed his offer in its fresh shape on the following day,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“your determined generosity has overcome me.
        Books I cannot refuse either for my own sake or my people’s. I
        sometimes feel that they are starved, or at the best ill-fed with
        spiritual food. I can speak to them of their every-day duties, but I
        cannot build them up in their faith for lack of knowledge in myself,
        and where is the knowledge to come from? Of books I have none but my
        Bible and my Service-book, and two small books of homilies. If I had
        some of the commentaries and homilies of the two great doctors of our
        Church, Hieronymus<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href=
        "#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> and
        Augustine, I should be well content. I have heard of the great
        preacher of Antioch and Constantinople, John the Golden Mouth,<a id=
        "noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a> but,
        alas, I cannot read Greek.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You shall have them as soon as they can be got,”</span>
        said the Count.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the course of
        the day the search party sent back from Sorbiodunum returned. They
        had found one of the stragglers still alive, and had brought him on
        to the village where the first halt had been made. There he was being
        carefully tended, but there was no chance of his being restored to
        health for many weeks to come. Of the other two they had a terrible
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181"
        id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>account to give. Only a few
        mangled remains could be discovered, the poor creatures having been
        manifestly devoured by wolves. All that could be hoped was that they
        had expired before they were attacked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count had now
        nothing to detain him, and as he was for many reasons anxious to be
        at home, where a multiplicity of duties were awaiting him, he
        determined to start on the following day. His route was first to
        Sorbiodunum. There he would be on the main road leading to Venta
        Belgarum.<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The journey to
        Venta Belgarum was accomplished in safety, and, by dint of starting
        long before sunrise, in a single day. The distance was a little more
        than twenty miles, and the road, which was so straight that the end
        of the journey might almost have been seen from the beginning, lay
        almost through an open country. This was favourable for speed, as
        there was little or no need to reconnoitre the ground in advance. It
        was just after sunrise when the party reached the spot where the
        traces of the great camp of Constantius Chlorus may still be seen. It
        had even then ceased to be occupied, but the soldiers’ huts were
        still standing, and the avenues, though overgrown with grass, looked
        as if they might easily be thronged again with all the busy life of a
        camp. The Count called a halt for a few minutes, and pointed out the
        locality to Carna.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“See,”</span> said he, with a sigh, <span class=

        "page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class=

        so much.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And was Constantine himself ever there?”</span> cried
        the girl, to whom the first Christian Emperor was the object of an
        admiration which we, knowing as we do more about him, can hardly
        share.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I doubt it,”</span> returned the Count. <span class=

        with Allectus. But, my child, I was thinking not of its past, but of

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why should it?”</span> exclaimed the girl, almost
        forgetting in her excitement that she was speaking to a Roman.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Why should it? Why should not Britain be
        happy and safe and free without the legions? Forgive me,
        father,”</span> she added, remembering herself again; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am the last person in the world who should be
        ungrateful to Rome.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I don’t blame you,”</span> said the Count, and as he
        looked at the maiden’s flashing eyes and remembered how bravely she
        had gone through terrors which would have driven most women out of
        their senses, he thought to himself—<span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, if
        there were but a few thousand men who had half the spirit of this
        woman in them, the end might be different. My child,”</span> he went
        on, <span class="tei tei-q">“I would not discourage you, but there

        herself. I am thankful that you will be safely away before it
        comes.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carna was about to
        speak, but checked herself. It was not the time she felt to speak out
        her heart.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For some time
        after this little or nothing of interest occurred; but as the party
        approached within a few miles of Venta the scene underwent a
        remarkable change. The road had hitherto been almost entirely
        deserted; it was now thronged: but the face of every passenger was
        turned towards Venta, not a single traveller was going the other way.
        Every by-way and bridle-path and foot-path that touched the road
        contributed to swell the throng. In fact, the whole countryside was
        in motion. And the fugitives, for their manifest hurry and alarm
        proclaimed to be nothing less, carried all their property with them.
        Carts laden with rustic furniture, on the top of which women and
        children were perched, waggons loaded with the harvest of the year,
        droves of sheep and cattle helped to crowd the road till it was
        almost impassable. And still the hurrying pace, the fearful anxious
        glances cast behind showed that it was some terrible danger from
        which this timid multitude was flying. For some time, so stupified
        with fear were the fugitives, Ælius could get no rational answer to
        the questions which he put. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Picts! The
        Picts! They are upon us!”</span> at last said a man whom a
        sud<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name=
        "Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>den catastrophe that
        brought a great pile of household goods to the ground, had compelled
        to halt, and who was glad to get the help of the Count’s attendants
        to restore them, all help from neighbours being utterly out of the
        question when all were selfishly intent on saving their own lives and
        property. When his property had been set in its place again the man
        thanked the Count very heartily, and was collected enough to tell all
        he knew.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There is no doubt that the Picts are not far off. I have
        not seen anything of them myself, thank heaven! but I could see the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Have they ever been here before?”</span></p>

        them in check. A party did slip by, I know, some little way to the
        westward, and I was glad to hear they got rather roughly handled.
        But, generally, they did not like to come anywhere near the camps.
        But now these are deserted, and there is nothing to keep them
        back.”</span></p>

        You are a Roman, I see, and, if I may judge, a man in authority, and
        you know that I am <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg

        do anything for ourselves, and how can we do it now at a few months’
        notice?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count made no
        answer; indeed, none was possible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And you expect to find shelter at Venta?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I don’t say that I expect it, but it is our only chance.
        The place has at least walls.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And any one to man them?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There should be some old soldiers, but how many I cannot
        say; anyhow, scarcely enough for a garrison.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the Count
        learned the situation he felt that his best course would be to press
        on with his party to Venta with all the speed possible. The chief
        authority of the town was in the hands of a native, who had the title
        of Head of the City.<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href=
        "#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> It was
        possible that this officer might be a man of courage and capacity;
        but it was far more likely that he would be quite unequal to the
        emergency. In either case the Count felt that his advice and personal
        influence might be of very great use. Even the twenty stout soldiers
        whom he had with him would be no inconsiderable addition to the
        fighting force of the place. Accordingly he gave orders to his
        followers to quicken their pace. Fortunately the greater part
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187"
        id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the fugitives was behind
        them; still it was no easy task for the party to make its way through
        the struggling masses of human beings and cattle, and it was past
        sunset when they rode up to the gates of Venta.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was evident
        that the bad news had already arrived. The gates were closely shut,
        while the walls were crowded with spectators anxiously looking
        northwards for signs of the approaching enemy. The porter was at
        first unwilling to admit the strangers, peering anxiously through the
        wicket at them, and declaring that he must first consult his
        superior. One of the spectators on the wall happened, however, to
        recognize the Count, and the party was admitted without further
        question, and rode up at once to the quarters of the Commander of the
        Town.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If he had hoped to
        find an official with whom it would be possible or profitable to
        co-operate in the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Princeps</span></span> of
        Venta, the Count was very much disappointed. He was an elderly man,
        who had realized a fair fortune by contracting for the provisioning
        of the army in Southern Britain, and had done very fairly as long as
        he had nothing to do but execute the orders of the military governor.
        Left to himself he was absolutely helpless. Indeed he had been taking
        refuge from his anxieties in the wine-cup, and the Count found him at
        least half intoxicated. At the moment of the party’s arrival the poor
        creature <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg
        188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had
        reached the valorous stage of drunkenness, and was loud in his
        declarations that there was no possible danger.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They will know better,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“than to come near Venta. If they do, very few will go
        back. Indeed I should like nothing better than to give them a lesson.
        You shall see something worth looking at if you will give us the
        pleasure of your company in our little town for a day or
        two.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another cup, which
        he drained to the prosperity of Britain and the confusion of her
        enemies, changed his mood. He now seemed to have forgotten all about
        the invaders, insisted on recognizing a dear friend of past times in
        the Count, and invited him to spend the rest of the day in talking
        over old times.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count did not
        waste many minutes with the old man, but when he left the house the
        darkness had already closed in. After finding with some difficulty
        accommodation for Carna, he returned to the gate, anxious to learn
        for himself how things were going on. He found the place a scene of
        frightful confusion. The warders had abandoned their office as
        hopeless. An incessant stream of fugitives, men, women, and children,
        mingled with carts and waggons of every shape and size, was pouring
        into the town. Every now and then one of these vehicles, brought out
        perhaps in the sudden emergency from the repose of years, broke down
        and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name=
        "Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>blocked the way. Then
        the living torrent began to rage at the obstacle, as a river in flood
        roars about a tree which has fallen across its current. Shortly the
        offending vehicle would be removed by main force, and with a very
        scanty regard for its contents. Then the uproar lulled again, though
        there never ceased a babel of voices, cursing, entreating,
        complaining, quarrelling, through all the gamut of notes, from the
        deepest base to the shrillest treble. The wall was crowded with the
        inhabitants of the town, and every eye was fixed intently on the
        northern horizon. There, as was only too plainly to be seen, the sky
        was reddened with a dull glow, which might have been described as a
        sunrise out of place, but that it was brightened now and then for a
        moment by a shoot of flame. <span class="tei tei-q">“Where are
        they?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“How soon will they be
        here?”</span> were the questions which every one was asking, and
        which no one attempted to answer. The Count made his way with some
        difficulty along the top of the rampart in search of some one from
        whom he might hope to get some rational account of the situation. At
        last he found among the spectators an old man, whose bearing struck
        him as having something soldierly about it. A nearer look showed him
        a military decoration. He lost no time in addressing him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Comrade,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I see
        that you have followed the eagles.”</span></p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The veteran
        recognized something of the tone of command in the Count’s voice, and
        made a military salute.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, sir, so I have, though my sword has been hanging up
        for more than thirty years.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And what do you think of the prospect?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Badly, sir, badly. This is just what I feared; but it
        has come even sooner than I looked for it. Things have been very bad
        for some time in the north ever since the garrisons were taken from
        the Wall,<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href=
        "#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        except for a troop of robbers now and then, we were fairly safe here.
        But now that these barbarians know that the legions are gone, there
        will be no stopping them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They are the Picts, I hear. Have you ever had to do with
        them?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, sir, I have seen as much of them as ever I want to
        see. I came to this island thirty-nine years ago with Theodosius,
        grandfather, you know, of the Augustus;”</span> and the old man, who
        was steadfastly loyal to the Emperor, bared his head as he spoke.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I am a Batavian from the island of the
        Rhine, and was then a deputy-centurion in Theodosius’ army. We found
        Britain full of the savages. They had positively over-run the whole
        country as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg
        191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>far
        as the southern sea, and only the walled towns had escaped them, and
        these were almost in despair. I shall never forget how the people at
        Londinium crowded about the general, kissing his hands and feet, when
        he rode into the town. But I must not tire you with an old soldier’s
        stories. You ask me about the Picts. They are the worst savages I
        ever saw, and I have had some experience too. They go naked but for
        some kind of a skin girdle about their loins, and they are hideously
        painted, and their hair is more like a beast’s than a man’s, and then
        they eat human flesh. Ah, sir, you may shake your head, but I know
        it. We used to find dead bodies with the fleshy parts cut off where
        they had been. I shudder to think of what I saw in those days. Well,
        we gave them a good lesson, drove them back to their own country, and
        an awful country it is, all lakes and mountains, with not so much as
        a blade of corn from one end to the other. But now they will be as
        bad as ever.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count said

        indeed it is just possible that they may not come at all. You see
        that they get a great quantity of plunder in the country without much
        trouble or danger, and they may leave the towns alone. Barbarians
        mostly don’t care to knock their heads against stone walls, and of
        course they think us a great deal stronger than we are.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After making an
        appointment with his new acquaintance for a meeting on the following
        day, the Count rejoined his party.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next day the
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Princeps</span></span> called a meeting of the
        principal burgesses of the town, at which the Count, in consideration
        of his rank as a Roman official, was invited to attend. The tone of
        the meeting was better than he had expected. There were one or two
        resolute men among the local magistrates, and these contrived to
        communicate something of their spirit to the rest. A general levy of
        the inhabitants <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg
        193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>between the ages of sixteen and sixty was to be
        made. The town was divided into districts, and recruiting officers
        were appointed for each. By an unanimous vote of the meeting the
        Count was requested to take the chief command. The delay of the
        invaders gave some time for carrying out these preparations for
        defence. A force was speedily raised, sufficient, as far at least as
        numbers were concerned, to garrison the walls. This was divided into
        companies, each having two watches, which were to be on duty
        alternately. The whole extent of work was divided among them, and the
        town was stored with such missiles as could be collected or
        manufactured, while Carna busied herself among the women, organizing
        the supply of food and drink for the guards of the wall, and
        preparations for the care of the wounded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Day after day the
        burgesses of Venta awaited the course of events. For some time they
        hoped that, after all, the town might not be visited by the invaders.
        The lurid glow of the skies by night, and the clouds of smoke by day,
        sometimes borne by the wind so close to the town that the smell could
        be distinctly recognized, proved that they were still near. But
        though the effects of their work of ruin were visible enough, of the
        barbarians themselves no one had yet caught a glimpse. But towards
        the evening of the seventh day after the Count’s arrival a party was
        seen to emerge from a wood, distant about half a mile from the gates.
        There were four in all; two of them were mounted on small and very
        shaggy ponies, the others were on foot. The party advanced till they
        were about a hundred yards from the wall, and though the fading light
        prevented them from being seen very clearly, there could be no doubt
        that they were some of the dreaded Picts.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A debate, which
        seemed, from the gesticulations of the speakers to be of a somewhat
        violent kind, was carried on for a time among the savages. Then one
        of the mounted men rode, with all the speed to which his diminutive
        horse could be urged, almost up to the gates of the town. He wore a
        deer-skin robe of the very simplest construction, with holes through
        which his head and arms were thrust. His legs were bare. Round his
        neck was hung a bow of a very rude kind. In his right hand he carried
        a short spear. With the butt of this he struck violently at the gate,
        as if demanding entrance, and after waiting a few seconds, as it
        seemed for an answer, turned his pony’s head and began to ride back
        to his party. He had almost reached them before the defenders of the
        wall had recovered from the astonishment which his audacity had
        caused them. Then one who was armed with a bow discharged at the
        retreating figure an arrow, which more by good luck than skill, for
        scarcely any aim had been taken, struck the Pict on the neck. He did
        not fall from his horse, but swayed heavily to one side, catching at
        the animal’s mane to steady himself. His three companions rushed
        forward to help him, and in another moment would have carried him
        off, but for the resolution and activity of the Saxon, who with the
        Count was standing on the rampart close to the gate. He lowered
        himself by his hands <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg
        196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>from
        the wall, a height of about fifteen feet, itself no small feat of
        activity, and ran at his full speed, a speed which, as has been said
        before, was quite uncommon. Hampered as they were by having to keep
        their wounded companion in the saddle, the Picts could move but
        slowly, and were soon overtaken. With two blows, delivered with all
        his gigantic strength, Cedric levelled two of them to the ground,
        and, seizing the wounded chief, threw him over his shoulder, then
        turning ran towards the gate. For a moment the third Pict stood too
        astonished to move. Cedric had thus a start of some yards, and before
        he could be overtaken, had got so close to the wall as to be under
        the protection of the archers and slingers who lined it. The next
        moment the wicket of the gate was opened, and the prisoner
        secured.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was evident
        that he was a prize of some value, for a rudely wrought chain of gold
        round his neck showed that he was a chief. He had ridden up to the
        gate against the advice of his followers, as it was guessed, under
        the influences of copious draughts of metheglin. The effect of the
        liquor, together with the pain of his wound and the shock of his
        capture, had been to make him insensible when he was brought into the
        town. While he was in this state his wound was dressed by a slave who
        had some surgical skill, and who declared that though serious it was
        not mortal. When he recovered consciousness <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>he behaved more like a wild beast than a man.
        His first act was to tear furiously at the bandage which had been
        applied to his wound. The attendants mastered him with difficulty,
        for he fought with the ferocity of a wild cat, and then bound his
        hands and feet. Thus rendered helpless, he raved at the top of his
        voice till sheer exhaustion reduced him to silence, a silence which
        was soon followed by sleep.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The night passed
        without any attack. It was evident that the Picts were in
        considerable force, for their watch fires were to be seen scattered
        over a wide extent of country, and there was much anxious talk in the
        town about the chances of a siege. Few indeed in Venta closed their
        eyes that night, and with the earliest morning the whole town was
        astir. The invaders, of course, had no notion of how a siege should
        be conducted, nor had they the necessary mechanical means even if
        they had known how to use them. Their arrows did but little harm, for
        their bows were ill made, and had but a small range, nothing like
        that which was commanded by the better weapons of the defenders. With
        the sling, however, they were singularly expert, and inflicted no
        small damage, making indeed some parts of the walls scarcely tenable.
        But as they could do nothing without showing themselves, they
        suffered more loss than they inflicted. In the early days of the
        siege especially, a catapult, which the garrison worked <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>from the walls, did great damage among
        them. After awhile they were careful not to collect in such numbers
        as to give a fair mark for this piece of artillery.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The townspeople
        were greatly elated at their success, and when, about a fortnight
        after the first appearance of the invaders before the walls, two days
        had passed without one of them being visible, concluded that,
        hopeless of making any impression upon the place, they had
        disappeared.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They were soon
        undeceived. It was growing dusk on the third day after the supposed
        departure of the enemy, when a heavily laden cart was drawn up to the
        western gate of the city. The driver, apparently a country man,
        knocked for admittance. By rights, at such an hour, it should have
        been refused, but the vigilance of the watch had begun to slacken,
        most of the besieged believing that the danger was practically over.
        Accordingly, no difficulty was made about throwing open the gates.
        But, once thrown open, they were not so easily closed. Just as the
        cart was passing through the opening in the wall one of the wheels
        came off, and the vehicle broke down hopelessly. Commonly it would
        not have taken long to clear the obstacle out of the way. There was
        usually a throng of people about the gates and on the walls, and a
        multitude of willing hands would have been ready to lend their help.
        But just at this moment the gates and walls were almost deserted.
        Even-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name=
        "Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>song was going on in
        the Church of Venta, and a preacher of some local fame was expected
        to enlarge on the Divine mercy shown in the deliverance of the town
        from the barbarians. The keepers of the gate would, therefore, have
        been at a loss even if they had seen the necessity of bestirring
        themselves. As it was, they were content to do nothing. They amused
        themselves by standing by and laughing at the rustic driver as he
        slowly unladed from his vehicle its miscellaneous cargo, the
        contents, it seemed, of one of the country-side cottages, from which
        the terror of the invasion had driven their inhabitants. The process
        of unloading, carried on slowly and with much grumbling, was scarcely
        half finished, when one of the warders, chancing to look behind him,
        caught sight of a body of men rapidly approaching through the
        darkness. A number of Picts had concealed themselves in the wood
        mentioned before as distant about half a mile from the wall, and when
        they saw the gate blocked by the broken-down cart—a part, it need
        hardly be said, of the stratagem—had made a rush to get to it before
        the obstacle could be removed. A hasty alarm was raised, and some of
        the citizens who were in hearing ran up. But it was too late. The
        rustic driver, a villain whose treacherous services had been bought
        by the enemy, had quickened his work when he saw his employers
        approaching, and contrived to finish the unloading of the cart at the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200"
        id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>very moment of their coming up.
        In a few moments some of them had clambered over the empty vehicle,
        struck down the guards, and disabled the fastenings of the gates.
        Before many minutes had passed the whole of the ground outside the
        gates seemed to swarm with the enemy, and though the townspeople had
        now begun to make a rally in force, it was too late to make any
        effectual effort to keep them out. The situation would in any case
        have been full of danger. At Venta it was hopeless. A garrison of
        veterans might have kept their heads, but there were not more than
        sixty or seventy among the defenders of Venta who had ever seen
        service in the field; and the citizen soldiers were fairly
        panic-stricken when they saw themselves actually facing a furious,
        yelling crowd of barbarians, cruel and savage creatures in reality,
        and commonly reported to be even worse than they were. Without even
        striking a blow they turned and fled. The Count, whom the alarm had
        just reached, was met, and, for a time, carried away by the tide of
        fugitives. Still he was able to rally a few men to his side for a
        last effort. Some of his own followers were with him, and the rest
        could be fetched in a few moments. The gallant old centurion, in
        spite of his seventy years, was prompt with the offer of his sword;
        and, as always happens, the infection of courage spread not less
        rapidly than the infection of cowardice. Altogether a compact body of
        about <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name=
        "Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a hundred men were
        collected. Well armed and well disciplined they turned a steadfast
        face to the enemy, and were able to make their retreat to a little
        fort which stood on a hill to the south-east of the town. Carna, the
        priest of Venta and his family, and a few other non-combatants were
        with them. More, in the terrible confusion of the scene, it was
        impossible to rescue. All through the trying time Cedric
        distinguished himself by his coolness and courage. When once he had
        seen Carna safely bestowed in the centre of the party, and had also
        seen that the person of the Pictish chief was secured (having the
        presence of mind to foresee that he would be a valuable hostage), he
        took up a position in the extreme rear of the retreat, and performed
        prodigies of valour in keeping the pursuers at bay.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The occupation of
        the fort could, of course, do nothing more than give them a breathing
        space. Though it had been for some time unoccupied, its defences were
        tolerably perfect, and it might have been held against a barbarian
        enemy as long as provisions held out. Unfortunately this was the weak
        part of their position. Of provisions they had very little. Luckily
        the place had latterly been used as a warehouse, and contained some
        sacks of flour. A few sheep were feeding in a meadow hard by, and
        were hastily driven within the defences. Happily there was a well
        within the walls.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg
        202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That night was a
        dismal experience which none of the party ever forgot. A confused
        noise came up from the town, where the savages were busy with plunder
        and massacre. Every now and then some piercing shriek was heard,
        curdling the blood of all the listeners. At other times the loud
        crash of some falling building could be distinguished. Towards
        midnight flames could be seen bursting out from various parts of the
        town, and before an hour had passed, every eye was fixed on a hideous
        spectacle, on which it was an agony to look, but from which it yet
        seemed impossible to turn. Venta was on fire. The flames could be
        seen to catch street after street, and distinctly against the lurid
        background of the burning houses could be seen, flitting here and
        there, as they busied themselves with the work of destruction, the
        dark shapes of the barbarians. When the morning dawned only a few
        detached buildings, among them the church, a basilica of some size,
        built by the munificence of the Empress Helena, were standing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The party in the
        fort reviewed their position anxiously. The civilians were for the
        most part in favour of staying where they were. They felt the
        substantial protection of the stout walls which surrounded them, and
        were indisposed to leave it. The military men, on the other hand,
        recognized facts more clearly and more completely. The protection
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203"
        id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the fort was worth this and
        this only—that it gave them time to reflect. To stand a siege would
        be to ensure destruction.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We must cut our way through,”</span> said the Count.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“If we do not try it now we shall have to try
        it three or four days hence, and try it with less courage, and hope,
        and strength, and probably fewer men than we have now.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Cut our way through all those thousands of
        savages!”</span> said the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Princeps</span></span>, who was one of the few
        who had escaped from the town. <span class="tei tei-q">“No; we should
        be fools to leave the shelter of these walls.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Shelter!”</span> cried the old centurion; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“will they shelter you against famine? No; let us go
        while we have strength to walk.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But how,”</span> said another of the townspeople,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“how will you do all the three things at
        once—retreat, and fight, and save the women? A few of the men may get
        through, but it will be as much as they can do to take care of
        themselves.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The argument was
        only too clear, and the Count turned away with a groan of despair.
        The prospect seemed hopeless. All the comfort that he could find was
        in the thought that he and Carna should anyhow, not fall alive into
        the hands of the barbarians.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But now Cedric
        came again to the rescue with the happy thought which had made him
        carry off the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg
        204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Pictish chief. He said nothing to any of his
        companions; but he managed the affair with the prisoner, and managed
        it with an astonishing speed and success. He pointed to a party of
        the chief’s fellow-countrymen who were approaching the fort, by way,
        it appeared, of reconnoitring its defences, and intimated that he
        wished to open communications with them, showing at the same time, by
        holding up two of his fingers, that not more than two were to
        approach. The chief, whose intelligence was sharpened by a keen sense
        of his danger, by a shrill piercing whistle, twice repeated, conveyed
        this intimation to his countrymen, and two of them approached to
        within speaking distance of the walls. Cedric now addressed himself
        to the task of making his prisoner understand that his life and
        liberty depended upon his inducing his countrymen to retire. This was
        not very easily done. The expressive gestures of drawing a knife
        across the throat was readily understood; and at last by a pantomime
        of signs he was made to comprehend that this would be the result, if
        his countrymen were to approach the walls. Then the other alternative
        was expressed. One of the bonds with which he was secured was
        partially loosed, and this action was accompanied by a sweeping
        gesture of the hand towards the north, which was to indicate that
        that must be their way, if he was to be freed. A light of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205"
        id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>comprehension gradually dawned
        in the chief’s eye, and the Saxon had little doubt that he had made
        his meaning intelligible. Whether the man could be trusted to keep
        the engagement was what neither he nor any one could say. But it was
        clear that the risk had to be run, for the only possible hope of
        escape lay in this direction. A conversation followed between the
        chief and his countrymen, accompanied by signs which were intended to
        convey to the Saxon the purport of what he was saying. When it was
        over, they disappeared, and the chief, turning to Cedric, raised his
        hands to the sky in a gesture which the latter interpreted, and
        rightly interpreted, to mean that he was calling the powers above to
        witness his fidelity to the engagement which he had made.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cedric then
        communicated the result of his negotiations through his interpreter
        the peddler to the Count. It was not received with unanimous approval
        by the party in the fort. The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Princeps</span></span>
        especially protested loudly against trusting their lives to the good
        faith of a couple of savages. <span class="tei tei-q">“A Pict and a
        Saxon!”</span> he cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“the worst enemies
        that Britain has, and you think that they are going to save
        us!”</span> He was quickly overruled by the Count, who let him
        understand quite plainly that he would be left to shift for himself
        unless he availed himself of this chance of escape.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Do as you please,”</span> was Ælius’s first utterance,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206"
        id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“you
        have authority over the fort, and if you choose to defend it with as
        many of your friends as you can induce to stay with you, I cannot
        hinder you. But you must take the consequences, and I haven’t the
        shadow of a doubt what these will be. Meanwhile, I and my party mean
        to go. As for the Pict, I know nothing of him; the Saxon I would
        trust with my life, and what is far dearer to me, the life of my
        daughter. He has proved his good faith already in such a way that I
        for one shall never doubt him again.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Preparations for
        departure were hastily made. Indeed there was little to prepare. The
        party had simply nothing with them except their arms. Every one had
        to walk—for food they had to trust to what they might find on the
        road. But before they started the Count loosed with his own hand the
        chief’s bonds. The chief put his hand upon his heart, and then lifted
        it to the sky with the same gesture of appeal that he made
        before.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is sufficient
        to say that he kept his word, for the party reached the coast without
        molestation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For several weeks
        life passed at the villa with little change or incident. But the
        Count, though he kept a cheerful face, and talked gaily of the future
        to his daughter and Carna, felt more acutely every day how full his
        position was of anxieties and difficulties. First came, as it always
        does come first, the question of money. It had never been a very easy
        matter to provide for the expenses of the fleet. Again and again the
        Count had drawn on his private means, which were happily very large.
        But these had lately been crippled by the troubled condition of the
        provinces in which his estates were situated, and even if they had
        been untouched the burden that now threatened to fall upon them would
        have been too great for them to bear. Some of the seaport towns
        would, he hoped, continue to pay their contributions. He was
        personally popular, and his influence would do something. Then,
        again, he could still <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg
        208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>give
        at least some return for the money. The sea-coast must be protected
        from the enemy, and no one could protect it so cheaply and so
        effectually as he. From the inland towns, which had always grumbled
        at having to pay an impost from which they saw no visible advantage,
        nothing was to be hoped. And any expectation of money from the
        authorities at home was quite out of the question.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One thing was
        quite certain: the establishment must be reduced within much narrower
        limits. He must diminish the fleet, and lessen also the range of
        shore which he professed to defend. He could not henceforth pretend
        to go north of the mouth of the Thamesis. For the coast southward and
        westward he might be able to provide more or less effectually. More
        he could not do.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the first
        necessities of the changed position in which he found himself was
        that he must give up the villa on the east coast. It would be a
        matter for after consideration whether the island of Vectis was not
        too much out of the way. But till that point could be settled, it
        would have to be his head-quarters. To carry out these new
        arrangements, and to wind up affairs in the region which he was
        preparing to relinquish, a voyage became necessary. On this voyage
        the Count started early in April. He arranged for disposing of that
        part of the fleet which he could not hope to keep in his own pay.
        Some of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg
        209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>oldest galleys were broken up; others were
        handed over to the authorities of the coast-towns, on the
        understanding that they were to man and pay them themselves. A few
        picked men were taken from the crews by the Count; the rest,
        excepting such as were re-engaged by the local authorities, were
        discharged. When this had been done, and the villa had been
        dismantled, the Count prepared to return to the island.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here, meanwhile,
        there had been trouble. The Saxon had quietly returned to his work at
        the forge, and would have been perfectly content, as far as could be
        judged from his demeanour, if only he had been left alone, and
        permitted to pay as before his distant worship to Carna. But to some
        members of the villa household he was an object of dislike. They were
        jealous of the favour in which the Count and the Count’s family held
        him. They were naturally not at all pleased at what they could not
        but acknowledge his great superiority in strength, and as Christians,
        though not particularly zealous in their performance of most of their
        duties, they felt themselves to be unquestionably zealous and sincere
        in their hatred and contempt for a pagan. The Saxon, on the other
        hand, heartily despised those by whom he was surrounded. They were
        slaves, or little better than slaves, and he was a freeman and a
        chief, though the gods had made him a prisoner. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>He went to and fro among them with a scorn
        which was not the less evident because it was not expressed in
        words.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a time this
        enforced silence helped to keep the peace; Cedric knew nothing of the
        British tongue, or of the mongrel Latin which sometimes took its
        place, and the other inhabitants of the villa nothing of Saxon. There
        were angry and contemptuous looks on both sides, but there was
        nothing more; or if there were words, these were harmless, because
        they were not understood. But by degrees this was changed. Cedric had
        intelligence of no common kind—indeed he was something of a poet
        among his own people—he had many motives for learning the language of
        those among whom he dwelt, his adoration for Carna being one of the
        most powerful, and he had, too, opportunities for learning. The
        peddler taught him much, and Carna, who never forgot her zealous
        desire for his conversion, taught him more. The end was that he
        picked up much of the British language with extraordinary rapidity,
        and, in little more than six months after his capture, could express
        himself with some ease and fluency.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was very well
        in its way, but it had the unfortunate result that he began to
        understand and be understood. Every day the relations between him and
        the domestics and artizans employed about the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>villa became worse and worse, and it was
        not long before matters came to a crisis.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cedric had
        repeatedly noticed that the tools which he used in the forge had been
        hidden or mischievously damaged. He was too proud to complain, and
        indeed his temper was curiously patient in any matter where he did
        not conceive his honour to be involved. He said nothing about the
        matter, searched for his missing tools, and if he could not find
        them, continued to do without them, and repaired the injuries as best
        he could. The offender, of course, grew bolder with impunity, and at
        last the limits of Cedric’s endurance were reached and passed. Coming
        into the forge at an unusually early hour one morning, he caught the
        doer of the mischief in the very commission of a more serious piece
        of mischief than he had yet ventured, namely, cutting a hole in the
        bellows. He lifted the offender by the skin of the neck—he was a lad
        of about sixteen, and son of the chief bailiff of the farm attached
        to the villa—shook him, as a dog shakes a rat, yet without forgetting
        that he was but a boy, dipped him head foremost in the bath of the
        forge, and then let him go, more dead than alive from the fear that
        he felt at finding himself in the hands of the great giant.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unluckily at the
        very moment when the young rascal was being dismissed in a paroxysm
        of howling with a contemptuous kick, his father entered the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212"
        id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>yard. No one about the place
        was more prejudiced against the Saxon, or more jealous of the favour
        in which he stood with the Count and his family. He had too, in its
        very worst form, the ungovernable Celtic temper, and now, when he saw
        his son, a spoilt boy whom everybody else disliked, ill-treated as he
        thought by the prisoner, he was fairly carried out of himself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pagan dog!”</span> he cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“do
        you dare to touch with your beast’s foot a Christian boy?”</span> and
        he struck at the Saxon with a long cart whip which he had in his
        hand.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The end of the
        lash caught the Saxon’s cheek, on which it raised an ugly-looking
        wheal. Even in the height of his passion the Briton stood aghast at
        the change which came in a moment over the form and features of the
        Saxon. One or two of the bystanders had seen him face to face with an
        enemy, and had wondered how strangely calm he had seemed to be,
        showing no sign of excitement, except a certain glitter in his eyes.
        He had a very different look now. <span class="tei tei-q">“The form
        of his visage was changed,”</span> as it was in the Babylonian
        king<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> when he
        found himself, for the first time in his life, confronted by a
        point-blank refusal to obey. A consuming anger, like the Berseker
        rage of his kinsmen of after times, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the Vikings, seemed to possess and transform
        him. His features worked, as if caught by some strange malady, his
        eyes literally blazed with fury, his whole figure seemed to dilate.
        The luckless bailiff was seized round the middle, lifted from the
        ground as easily as if he had been a child in arms, and hurled with a
        crash, like a bolt from a catapult, against the wall. He lay there
        bleeding from nose and mouth, while the horror-stricken Britons stood
        helpless and afraid to move.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Dogs of slaves,”</span> cried Cedric, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“do you dare to growl at your master;”</span> and he
        swept through the terrified crowd, laying them low on either side.
        Happily at the moment he had no weapon in his hand, but he seized a
        bar of iron from the anvil of the forge, and swinging it round his
        head, prepared, it seemed, to deal about him an indiscriminate
        destruction. What would have followed it is impossible to say. In his
        fury and in his absolute mastery over that shrinking crowd, he was
        like a tiger in the midst of a flock of sheep. But at the critical
        moment, before his hand had dealt a single blow, the apparition of
        Carna interposed between him and his victims. The uproar in the court
        had reached her in her chamber, and brought her ready to play her
        accustomed part of peacemaker. Now she stood, her figure framed like
        a picture, in the door which opened on the court from the part of the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214"
        id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>villa which she occupied. She
        wore a simple dress of white, fastened with a blue girdle; her long
        chestnut hair fell in loose waves to her waist, for she had not had
        time to arrange it in more orderly fashion. Her face was pale and
        troubled, her eyes wide open with a sad surprise. It was indeed
        another Cedric that she saw from the one whom she had known. Was this
        terrible savage, who looked more like some dreadful spirit from the
        abyss than a human creature, the gentle giant in whose mute homage
        she had felt such an innocent pleasure, the hopeful pupil whom she
        was teaching, as she hoped, to put away savage ways for the mild and
        peaceful behaviour of a Christian. As for Cedric, he seemed paralyzed
        at the vision that presented itself to him. The sight of the girl
        always moved him strangely; now she reminded him of the time when he
        had first seen her by the bedside of his dying brother; and the
        remembrance completed, if anything was needed to complete, the
        impression. The fury that had transfigured him seemed to pass away;
        his hand loosed its hold on the weapon which he held. His adversaries
        did not fail to use the opportunity. They had been too genuinely
        frightened to let it slip when it came. Indeed they may be excused
        for feeling that this most formidable enemy had to be secured against
        doing any more damage. The moment they saw him unarmed they sprang
        with one movement <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg
        215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>on
        him and overpowered him. Even then, if he had offered resistance,
        they might have had no small trouble, perhaps might have failed in
        securing him. But he stood passive, and allowed his hands to be bound
        without a struggle, and followed without difficulty when he was led
        to the room where offenders were commonly confined. Some of the
        meaner spirits in the household were disposed to visit their feelings
        of annoyance and humiliation on his head, now that he seemed to be in
        their power. But others felt a salutary dread of rousing the sleeping
        lion whose rage they had seen could be so terrible. Carna too did not
        abandon her <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">protegé</span></span>. He was
        chained, indeed, to a staple in the wall of the room which served as
        his prison. This seemed nothing more than a necessary precaution. But
        the girl let it be distinctly understood that no cruelty must be used
        to him, and she took care herself that his supply of food should be
        plentiful and good.</p>

        "font-size: 100%">THE ESCAPE.</span></span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prisoner
        seemed to submit to his fate with patience. He thanked the attendant
        who brought him his rations with a nod and smile, and disposed of the
        food with an appetite which seemed to indicate a cheerful temper. A
        visit which the peddler paid him the second day of his imprisonment
        was apparently received as a welcome relief. The two had a long and
        friendly conversation, nor did Cedric utter a word of complaint
        against his treatment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In reality the
        young chief was keeping under his rage with an effort almost
        unbearably painful. That he should be chained like a dog to the wall
        was an intolerable grievance; he, a free man, and the son of a long
        line of chiefs which boasted the blood of the great Odin himself! The
        iron did indeed enter into his soul, and the seeming calm of his
        outward patience concealed a whole volcano of inward fury.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217"
        id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>It was only the hope of freedom
        that kept him calm. It was that he might not diminish this hope, this
        almost desperate chance, by the very smallest fraction that he ate
        and drank with such seeming cheerfulness. He would want, he knew, all
        his strength for an escape. He would support it and husband it to the
        utmost.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And for an escape,
        unknown to his keepers, he was steadily preparing. The chain which
        bound him to the wall was fastened round his right arm and leg, and
        the fastening would have seemed secure to any ordinary observer. But
        such an observer would not have made the necessary allowance for the
        young man’s ordinary vigour and endurance. His hand was large and
        muscular; far too much so, one would have thought, to pass through
        the ring which had been welded round the arms. But he possessed an
        unusual power of contracting it. To exercise this power was indeed a
        painful effort, causing something like an agonizing cramp; still it
        was an effort that could be made, and made without disabling the
        limb. It could not, however, be done twice, because the hand,
        recovering its shape from the extraordinary pressure to which it had
        been subjected, would infallibly swell. Cedric, accordingly, after
        satisfying himself that it could be done, postponed actually doing it
        till the moment of escape had arrived. The fastening of the leg was
        less manageable. He <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg
        218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>would not have scrupled to do as the Spartan
        prisoner is said to have done, and cut off the foot which impeded his
        escape, but he had positively nothing with which this could be done.
        The only alternative was to drag the staple from the wall, and to
        carry it and the chain along with him. Fortunately, strong as it was,
        it was light. The staple at first seemed obstinate. It had indeed
        been subjected to tests which satisfied the villa blacksmith of its
        capacity of resistance. But repeated efforts, made with all the
        enormous strength which the young giant could bring to bear, weakened
        its hold, and at last it gave. The prisoner was prudent enough not to
        complete the separation of the iron from the walls. It would have
        been difficult to replace it so as to escape the notice of the
        attendant. Accordingly the drag was relaxed as soon as the first
        indications of yielding were felt. The time for attempting the escape
        was a subject of much anxious deliberation. The obvious course would
        have been to choose some hour between midnight and dawn; but Cedric
        had heard from time to time the step of some one walking up and down
        before his prison, and he guessed that it might be guarded at night,
        but left during the day-time, on the presumption that the captive
        would scarcely make an effort to escape while it was light. It was
        this accordingly that he resolved to do. Shortly after sunrise the
        attendant paid him his customary visit, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>bringing with him the morning meal. Cedric
        pretended to be but half awake, and, returning his salutation in a
        mumbling, sleepy tone, turned again on his side, as if to continue
        his slumbers. But the moment after the man had left the room he was
        at work. He dragged his hand through the ring, at the cost of a pang
        which taxed his endurance to the utmost; pulled the staple from the
        wall, wound the chain round his leg, and wrenching away one of the
        iron bars of the window, dropped through the opening thus made on to
        the ground. His calculation was correct. The ground was clear. Then
        another question presented itself to him. Should he attempt to escape
        as he was? He knew where a boat was commonly kept, and it had been
        his plan to take this and row out to sea in the hope of meeting some
        one of his countrymen’s galleys. If he once got off from the shore he
        was free, for if the worst came to the worst, he could at least die
        as a free man should. But should he go unarmed, and with the
        hampering chain about his leg? A moment’s consideration—no more was
        possible—decided him. He would make one more bold effort. The forge
        was close at hand, and he knew from having worked there that at that
        hour in the morning it was commonly empty, the workmen leaving it for
        their morning meal. There he could find what he wanted, a file to
        release himself from the chain, and a weapon.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The forge was
        empty, as he had expected. The question was, How long would it remain
        so? The workmen, he could see, had but just left it. The fire had not
        died down to the lowest, showing that the bellows had been recently
        at work, and a piece of iron that had been left, half-wrought, on the
        anvil, was still hot, as he could feel from putting his hand near it.
        It might be safest to take a file and escape with it at once. On the
        other hand, it would be far better to release himself at once from
        his encumbrance, in the event of having to run or fight for his life.
        He might count, he thought, upon half an hour, and he resolved to
        file away the chain then and there. With admirable coolness he sat
        down and applied all the strength and skill which he possessed to the
        work, and had finished it in little more than half the time which he
        had reckoned to have undisturbed. He then caught up a sword which
        hung on one of the walls. It was an old-fashioned weapon, but Cedric,
        who knew good iron when it came in his way, had tried its temper, and
        knew it to be capable of doing good service.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far everything
        had favoured him, nor did his good fortune desert him now. He found
        the boat, which was one commonly used for fishing by the inmates of
        the villa, ready furnished with oars and a small mast and sail. There
        were even, by good luck, a small jar of water, some broken food in a
        hamper, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name=
        "Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>left by a party which
        had been using it the day before, with some fishing lines. These,
        Cedric thought to himself, might be useful if he failed to fall in
        with any of his countrymen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jumping on board,
        he plied his sculls rapidly, going in the direction of the sea, and
        keeping as close under the shore as possible, so as to be out of
        sight of the villa. As it happened, this precaution was unnecessary.
        His absence was not discovered till shortly afternoon, when the
        attendant, bringing the midday meal, was astonished beyond measure to
        find the room empty. But another danger threatened him, a danger
        which he had not indeed forgotten, but against which he had known it
        to be impossible to take any precautions. This was the chance of
        meeting with the Count’s squadron as it was returning to the island;
        and it was this that he actually encountered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just as he had
        reached the mouth of the Haven and was turning his boat eastward, he
        saw within a hundred yards of him one of the Roman galleys. It was
        not the Count’s own vessel, for this had been delayed by an accident
        to the rigging, and was now many miles behind, but was in charge of
        the second-in-command. The recognition was mutual. Cedric’s tall
        figure was not one that could be easily mistaken, nor could it be
        doubted that he was attempting an escape. Had the Count been there
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222"
        id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he would probably have parleyed
        with the fugitive. The officer in command was not so considerate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Shoot,”</span> he cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“he is
        trying to escape,”</span> and as he spoke he seized a bow which lay
        on deck, and took aim at the Saxon. His order was immediately
        observed, and a shower of missiles was directed at the boat. They all
        fell short, for Cedric had by this time increased his distance. In a
        minute or two, however, the ship was put about, and then began to
        gain rapidly on the solitary rower.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another volley was
        discharged, and this time one of the arrows took effect, wounding the
        fugitive slightly in the left arm. The situation was desperate. To
        remain in the boat was to await certain death. A third volley would
        unquestionably be fatal. Cedric jumped overboard, but still clung to
        the side of the boat. It was only just in time. The third volley was
        discharged, and rattled on the upturned keel of the boat so thick as
        to show plainly what the fate of the occupant would have been. Still,
        though he had escaped for the moment, Cedric’s fate seemed sealed.
        The boat had given him shelter for the time, but to go on clinging to
        it would be to ensure his capture. He left it, and after making a few
        vigorous strokes, threw up his arms from the surface of the water,
        and uttering a loud cry, disappeared.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His quick eye had
        discerned a great mass of sea-weed floating on the water about fifty
        yards away, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg
        223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and
        his ready intelligence had seen a chance, small indeed and almost
        desperate, but still a chance of escape. Swimming under water to the
        sea-weed, he was able to come to the surface and to take breath under
        its shelter.</p>

        galley every one of course supposed him to have sunk. His action of
        the lifted arms and the loud cry had been natural enough to deceive
        the most wary observer. The boat was righted and secured by a rope,
        and the galley pursued its way to the villa, while Cedric was left to
        make the best of his way to the land.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day after
        Cedric’s disappearance the Count returned to the island. The prospect
        before him had not by any means lightened. Britain, conquered,
        oppressed, protected, for nearly four hundred years, governed
        sometimes ill and sometimes well, according to the varying characters
        of the Roman legates, but never allowed to do anything for herself,
        was not ready at a moment’s notice to be independent and stand alone.
        The Count was much too shrewd a man to hope that she would. Still,
        even he had not realized how bad things would be; and when he came to
        see them face to face he felt something like disappointment, and even
        despair. A man will often make up his mind to the general fact of
        failure, and yet be almost as much vexed at the details of failure,
        when it comes, as if he had expected success.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact was that
        the Count had found little or no disposition in the native States to
        take up and carry <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg
        225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>on
        the work which he was being compelled to give up. They would make no
        sacrifices, or even efforts. They refused to work together. Each
        reckoned on its own chance of escaping the common danger, and would
        not contribute to the defence that might possibly be wanted for its
        neighbours, and not for itself. Then jealousies and enmities,
        hitherto kept in check by the strong hand of a master, began to break
        out. The cities seemed likely, not only not to combine against Picts
        and Saxons, but actually to go to war among themselves. The Count
        felt all the pain that comes to an honest and capable man when he has
        to face the breaking up of a bad system which he has inherited from
        predecessors less high principled than himself. It happens very often
        that revolutions come in the days, not of the worst offenders, but of
        the men who are making sincere endeavours to do their duty. And so it
        was with the Count.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was in a very
        gloomy and depressed condition of mind, therefore, that he returned
        to the villa. And almost every day brought news of fresh troubles and
        disasters. Some of the Roman houses scattered through the country had
        been attacked and burnt of late. Since the central authority had been
        weakened the Roman residents had sometimes begun to behave in a
        lawless and oppressive way to their British neighbours, and these
        were taking their revenge with the cruelty that is always natural to
        the oppressed. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg
        226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Tragical tales of villas surrounded by
        infuriated crowds of Britons, of masters and families shut up within
        the walls, and perishing in the fires that consumed them, were
        brought to the Count by the scared survivors who had contrived to
        escape from the general destruction.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count’s
        personal difficulties were considerable. He had a considerable colony
        now settled near the villa, and many of its members were helpless and
        dependent people. The question of feeding them would soon become an
        urgent one. At present he could use the surplus stores which would no
        longer be wanted now that his squadron had been so reduced in
        strength. And there was another question that pressed upon his
        mind—that of defence. Already he had had to contract his operations.
        With single pirate vessels, or even small squadrons of two or three,
        he would be able to deal, but anything stronger would have to be left
        alone. With the few ships that were left to him it would be madness
        to run any risk. And what, he could not help thinking, if the Saxons
        were to attack the villa itself? It had been built as a pleasure
        residence, and though now fortified as far as circumstances
        permitted, could not be held against a strong force. Should he
        continue to occupy, or should he retire to the camp of the Great
        Harbour, which would at least be a more defensible
        position?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg
        227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may easily be
        imagined that these anxieties, which had been troubling his thoughts
        during the whole time of his absence, were not relieved when he heard
        the story of what had happened during his absence. He owed the Saxon
        more than he could ever repay, for he shuddered to think what would
        have happened to Carna but for his strength and energy. And apart
        from this feeling of gratitude, he admired the man’s splendid courage
        and tenacity. He had even come to rely upon him for services of
        unusual difficulty and danger. And now, to think that he was lost to
        them by the stupid perversity and jealousy of a set of slaves!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The said slaves
        had a bad time with their master for some days after his return.
        Good-humoured and kind as he was, yet he was a Roman—in other words,
        he had inherited the lordly temper of a race which had ruled the
        world for five hundred years, and any contradiction that thwarted him
        in one of his serious convictions or purposes, broke through the
        veneer of refinement and culture that commonly concealed the sterner
        part of his nature. A Christian master could not crucify an
        offender—indeed, crucifixion had been long since forbidden by the
        law—but he had almost unlimited power over life and limb. Life,
        indeed, the Count was too conscientious a follower of his religion to
        touch, but he had no scruple about going to the very utmost verge of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228"
        id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>severity in the use of minor
        punishments. As for his daughter, she was only too like her father to
        be any check on his anger, and for the first time in her life Carna
        found her mediation useless.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Girl,”</span> he said to her on one occasion, when she
        had urged her intercession with tears, <span class="tei tei-q">“you
        do not know what mischief these foolish, cowardly knaves have done.
        One thing I see plainly, that as soon as ever the Saxons know the
        weakness of the position we shall not be able to hold it any longer.
        There is nothing to hinder them from coming and burning the whole
        place over our heads; nothing in the way of fortifications, and
        certainly nothing in the way of garrison. They did not know all this
        before, but they are sure to know it soon; and we shall see the
        consequences before many months are over.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the course of
        the summer occurred an incident which diverted the Count’s attention
        for a time, though it did not lessen his perplexities.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One morning a
        small trading vessel entered the haven near the villa. Her business,
        it was found, was to land a stranger, who had bargained for a passage
        to the island. The trader had come from a port of Western Gaul, and
        had then taken her passenger on board. Who he was the captain could
        not say, except that he had the appearance of a Roman gentleman. The
        day after they had set sail an illness, which had evidently been upon
        him when <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg
        229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he
        came on board, had increased to such an extent that he had lost
        consciousness. Two or three days of delirium had been succeeded by
        stupor; in this condition the unfortunate man still lay. But while
        still conscious he had written down his destination, and added an
        appeal to the compassion of his future host. The Count read on the
        paper which the merchant captain handed to him a few words written in
        a trembling hand. They ran as follows:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style=
        "margin-bottom: 2.00em; margin-top: 2.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">In case I should not be able to speak for
        myself, I invoke by these words the compassionate protection of the
        Count Ælius. Let him not fear to receive me, but believe that I am
        unfortunate rather than guilty, and that there is between us the tie
        of a great common affection.</span></span>”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count did not
        recognize the stranger, though a dim impression of having seen him
        before floated across his mind; and there was something in his
        appearance which agreed with the trading captain’s conviction that he
        was a man of birth and position. In any case Ælius was not one who
        was inclined to resist such an appeal to his compassion. The
        stranger, still unconscious, was landed, together with a few effects
        which were said to belong to him, and at once handed over to the care
        of Carna. All her diligence and watchfulness as a nurse, and all the
        skill of the old physician, were wanted before the patient could be
        brought back to life. For fourteen <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>days he lay hovering on the very verge of death,
        mostly sunk in a stupor so complete that it was barely possible to
        perceive either pulse or breath; sometimes muttering in delirium a
        few broken sentences, of which all that physician and nurse were able
        to distinguish was that they were certainly Latin, and that they
        seemed to be verse.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was on the
        morning of the fifteenth day that there came a change. Carna sat by
        the window of the sick man’s room. It had a southern aspect, and the
        sunshine came with a softened brilliance through the thick tinted
        glass, and brought out the exquisite tints of the girl’s glossy hair,
        as she sat bending over the embroidery with which she was employing
        her nimble, never-idle fingers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“By heaven! another, fairer Proserpine!”</span> said the
        sick man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The girl turned
        her head at the sound of the clearly pronounced words which her
        practised ear distinguished at once from the strained or blurred
        utterances of delirium.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She held up her
        finger to her lips. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not speak,”</span>
        she said; <span class="tei tei-q">“you have been very ill, and must
        not tire yourself.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Lady,”</span> said the sick man, with a smile,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“you must at least let me ask you where I
        am.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, you shall hear, if you will promise to ask no more
        questions, but to be content with what you are <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>told. You are with friends, in the island
        of Vectis, in the house of Ælius, Count of the Saxon Shore. And now
        be quiet, and don’t spoil all our pains in making yourself ill
        again.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She gave him a
        little broth which was being kept hot by the fire in readiness for
        the time when he should recover consciousness; and after this had
        been disposed of, and she had found by feeling his pulse that he was
        free from fever, a small quantity of well diluted wine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And now,”</span> she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“you
        must sleep”</span>—a command which he was ready enough to obey.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After this his
        recovery was rapid. For a time, indeed, the cautious old physician,
        though he did not forbid conversation, prohibited any reference to
        business. <span class="tei tei-q">“You will want, of course,”</span>
        he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“to tell your story, and to make
        your plans for the future; that will excite you, and, till you are
        stronger, may bring about a relapse. Be content for a while with the
        ladies’ company”</span>—Ælia, now that no nursing had to be done, was
        often with her foster-sister—<span class="tei tei-q">“the Count will
        see you when I give permission.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And much talk the
        ladies had with him, and greatly astonished they were at the variety
        and brilliance of his conversation. He seemed equally familiar with
        books and men. He had read everything—so at least thought the two
        girls, who were sufficiently well educated to recognize a full mind
        when they came <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg
        232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>across it—he had been everywhere, he had seen
        everybody. He never boasted of his intimacy with great people, and
        indeed very seldom mentioned a name, but his allusions showed that he
        was equally familiar with courts and camps. It would have puzzled
        more experienced persons than the sisters to guess who this man of
        the world, who was also a man of letters, could possibly be.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the end of
        another week the physician removed his prohibition, and the Count,
        who had hitherto judged it better not to agitate his guest by his
        presence, now paid a visit to his room.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a few kindly
        inquiries as to his health, the Count went on, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Understand me, sir, that I have no wish to force any
        confidence from you. My good fortune gave me the chance of serving
        you, but it has not given me the right of asking you questions which
        you might not care to answer. You are welcome to my hospitality as
        long as you choose to remain here, and you may command my help when
        you wish to go. But of course, if you care to give me your
        confidence, it may make the help a great deal more
        effective.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yours is a true hospitality,”</span> answered the
        stranger, with a smile, <span class="tei tei-q">“but it is right that
        you should know who I am, and how I came to be here; and I have only
        been waiting for the good Strabo’s leave to tell you. But may your
        daughter and her sister be present? I have a sad story to relate, but
        there is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg
        233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class=

        and they have been good enough to show some interest in an unhappy

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They shall come, if you wish it,”</span> said the Count,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“indeed they have been almost dying of
        curiosity.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was to this

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count rose

        There never was such a man. I knew him well. He was always ready,

        lion, and yet never doing anything by force that he could contrive by
        stratagem. But tell me—they had, or pretended to have, some cause.
        What was it?”</span></p>

        had to save the Empire without soldiers. He did it again and again;
        he played off one barbarian power against another with consummate
        skill; and filled his legion one day with the enemies whom he had
        routed the day before. But this could not be done without intrigues,
        without devices which, taken by themselves, looked like treason. But
        it is idle to speak of the past. He lies in a dishonoured grave, and
        the Empire of Augustus is tottering to its fall.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        my tale. You know he might have had the Empire; the soldiers offered
        it to him; Alaric and his Goths would have been delighted to help
        him. But he refused. He was loyal to the last. He would not even fly.
        There are many places where he would have been safe——”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, he would go to none of them. He went to the one
        place where safety was impossible. He went to Ravenna; and at Ravenna

        238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        Emperor down to the meanest slave, was an enemy. He wanted to make
        them trust him by trusting them—as if one disarmed a tiger by going
        into his lair! He had two or three of his chief officers with him,
        besides myself, and as many slaves. We had not a weapon of any kind
        among us. Stilicho made a point of our being unarmed. Well, we had
        not an encouraging greeting when we entered the city. Every one, as
        you may suppose, recognized him. Indeed, there was no man, I suppose,
        in the whole Empire, who was better known. No one who had ever seen
        Stilicho could forget that towering form, that white head.<a id=

        were sullen looks as we walked through the streets, and hisses, and
        even some stone throwing. However, we got safe to our lodgings, and
        passed the night without disturbance. The next day, as we were
        standing in the market-place, an old Vandal soldier—one of the
        general’s countrymen, you know—put a flower in his hand as he walked
        by, without saying a word, or even looking at him; for it would have
        been as much <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg
        239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as
        his life was worth to be seen communicating with us. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘An old comrade,’</span> said Stilicho, who never forgot
        a face. <span class="tei tei-q">‘He served with me in Greece.’</span>
        The flower was a little red thing; the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘shepherd’s hourglass’</span> they call it, because it
        shuts when there is rain coming. It was a warning. There was danger
        close at hand. The general said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘We must
        take sanctuary.’</span> Then he called me to him. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Leave me, Claudian,’</span> he said; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘you cannot take sanctuary with us, for you are not a
        baptized man. I do not count much on the Church’s protection; but
        still it may give me time to make my defence to the Emperor. So you
        must look out for your own safety. But surely they can’t be base
        enough to harm you, for what you have done?’</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘I don’t know about that, my Lord,’</span> I answered;
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘you remember the fable of the
        trumpeter.<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href=
        "#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a> Anyhow,
        I shall follow you as far as I can.’</span> Well, he went into the
        great church—what used to be the Basilica before Constantine’s
        time—and took sanctuary by the altar. I did not go further than the
        nave. In the course of an hour or so comes the bishop, with the
        archdeacon and two or three priests, and following them one of the
        great officers of the Court, with a body-guard. The church was
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240"
        id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>now crowded from end to end;
        the people had climbed up into the pulpit, and every accessible spot
        from which they could get a view of what was going on. I think that
        there was a reaction in the general’s favour. No one, whose heart was
        not flint, could see the man who had saved the Empire, and that not
        once or twice, a suppliant for his life. Well, I could not see for
        myself what went on, but I heard the story afterwards. The bishop
        brought a safe-conduct from the Emperor; or rather the chamberlain
        brought it, and the bishop gave it to Stilicho, with his own
        guarantee. I can’t believe that a man of peace and truth, as he calls
        himself, could have been a party to so base a fraud—he must have been
        deceived himself. Well, the safe-conduct promised that the general
        should be heard in his own defence; and he wanted nothing more. I
        doubt whether a trial would have served him; but they never intended
        to give him even so much. As soon as he was out of the church I could
        see what was meant, for I followed him. The chamberlain’s body-guard
        drew their swords. Well, I was wrong to say that he had no friends in
        Ravenna. He had a friend even in that crew of hirelings—another of
        his old soldiers, I daresay. I told you that Stilicho had neither
        armour nor weapon. Well, in a moment, no one could see how, there was
        a long sword lying at his feet. He took it up; and, verily, if he had
        used <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name=
        "Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it, he would at least
        have sold his life dearly. The general was a great swordsman, as good
        a swordsman as he was a general. But no; he would not condescend to
        it; after a soldier’s first impulse to take the weapon, he made no
        use of it. He pointed it to the ground, and stood facing his enemies.
        Ah! it was a noble sight—that grand old man looking steadfastly at
        that crew of murderers. For a few moments they seemed cowed. No one
        lifted his hand—then some double-dyed villain crept behind and
        stabbed him. He staggered forward, and immediately there were a dozen
        swords hacking at him. At least his was no lingering death. They cut
        off that grand white head and carried it to the Emperor; his body
        they threw into the pit where they bury the slaves. And that was the
        end of the saviour of the Empire.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And about yourself?”</span> said the Count.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> went on the poet, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have since thought that if I had been a man I should
        have died with him. But when I knew that he was dead, I was coward
        enough to fly. You would not care to hear how I spent the next few
        days. I had a few gold pieces in my pocket, and I found a wretched
        lodging in one of the worst parts of the city, and I lay there in
        hiding. One day I was having my morning meal at a wine shop, when a
        shabbily dressed old man, who sat next, turned to me in a meaning
        way, and, pouring a few <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg
        242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>drops out of his wine cup, said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘To Apollo and the Muses.’</span> That is a crime
        now-a-days, in some places at least, Ravenna among them; and he
        wanted, I suppose, to put me at my ease. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Will you not do the same,’</span> he went on,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘of all men in the world there is no one who
        has better cause.’</span> Pardon me, illustrious Count, if I repeat
        his flatteries. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Whom do you take me
        for?’</span> said I, for one gets to be a sad coward after a few
        days’ hiding, and I was unwilling to declare myself. He replied by
        repeating some of my verses in so meaning a way that I could not
        misunderstand him. <span class="tei tei-q">‘These wine-bibbers
        here,’</span> he went on, <span class="tei tei-q">‘don’t know one
        verse from another, but they might catch up a name. Come along with
        me; I will give you a flask of something better than this sour
        stuff.’</span> Well, we went to his house, which was close to the
        harbour. He was the owner, I found, of two or three small trading
        vessels. The house was a veritable temple of the Muses, ornamented
        with busts of the poets—my own I was flattered to see among them—and
        containing an excellent library of books. Manlius—that was my
        friend’s name—had heard me recite at Rome; and he recognized me
        partly from memory, partly from my resemblance to the bust. To make a
        long story short, he entertained me most hospitably for several days,
        while we discussed the question what was to become of me. Home I
        could not go, not, at least, till there should be a change in
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243"
        id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the Emperor’s surroundings. The
        further I got from Italy the more chance there would be of safety. We
        thought of North-western Gaul or Britain, or of getting across the
        Rhine. The end of it was that the good fellow took me across Italy,
        disguised as his servant, to Genoa, where he had correspondents. From
        Genoa I went to Marseilles, and from Marseilles overland to Narbonne,
        using now the character of a bookseller’s agent, one which I thought
        myself better qualified to sustain than any other. At Narbonne I
        found employment as a bookseller’s assistant, till I could get a
        letter from my wife in Africa with some money. That came in due
        course, and then I set off on my travels again, still working
        northwards. Then, sir, I thought of you. I had often heard the great
        man speak of you. You served under him against the Bastarnæ,<a id=

        and it occurred to me that for Stilicho’s sake you might give me
        shelter. Not that it matters much to me. To Stilicho I owe so much
        that I can scarcely imagine life without him. He gave me honour,
        wealth, even,”</span> added the poet, with a sad little smile,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“even my wife, for it was not my courting,
        but the Lady Serena’s<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href=

        to bring me here. I had been sickening for some time, and I remember
        little or nothing from the time of my embarking. There, sir, you have

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count’s
        difficulties did not seem to diminish as the year advanced. Money
        grew scarcer and scarcer, till it was only by pledging his personal
        credit to the merchants of Londinium and other towns in Britain that
        he was able to find the pay for the crews of his little squadron. His
        credit happily was still good, a character of twenty years without a
        single suspicion on his integrity standing him in good stead. Then a
        disaster happened to one of the few ships that he had retained. After
        a fierce encounter with a Saxon galley, in which its crew had been
        much weakened, it had been caught in a storm and driven on the deadly
        western shore of the island, still dreaded under the name of the
        Needles by those who navigate the Channel. The ship became a complete
        wreck and only a small portion of the crew escaped with their lives,
        all the disabled men being lost.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the Count’s
        chief perplexities were within <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>rather than without. For more than twenty years
        he had yielded an unquestioning obedience to the authorities at home.
        It is true that very little had been demanded of him. He had been
        given a free hand, and left to do his duty with very little
        interference, if with very little help. But now in the news of
        Stilicho’s death his loyalty had received a tremendous shock. How was
        he to bear himself to a ruler who was capable of committing so great
        a crime? True, he knew enough of the Emperor to be sure that he was
        only a tool in the hands of others, but this did not make the matter
        one whit better. Such tools are often more mischievous than men who
        are actively wicked. What then was he to do? Should he join the
        usurper Constantine, of whose astonishing success in Gaul and Spain
        he had heard the most glowing reports? His pride forbad it—an Ælius
        doing homage to a man who but twelve months before had been a private
        soldier! The thought was impossible. Should he retire into private
        life? But would not that be to shirk his duty, not to mention the
        fact that to retire is the one thing which in troubled times a man in
        a conspicuous position cannot do. One thing, indeed, was evident—that
        a decision would have to be made speedily. His position was rapidly
        becoming untenable, and he would have to make up his mind, without
        much delay, as to the best way of getting out of it. In the end
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247"
        id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it happened to him as it
        happens to so many of us, that his mind was made up for him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One day, towards
        the end of August, he was about to seek in a day’s sport a little
        relief from his many cares. It was still about four hours to noon,
        and he was sitting under a cherry tree (one of his own planting) in
        the villa garden, and sharing a slight meal of milk and wheaten cakes
        with his daughter and Carna, both of whom he had persuaded to
        accompany him. A young Briton stood by holding in a leash a couple of
        dogs very much like the greyhounds of our own times; another carried
        a bow and a quiver; a third had a game bag of leather, with a netted
        front, slung across his shoulders.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sailing-master
        of one of the galleys approached and saluted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There is a galley,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“coming up the Haven, and I thought that you should know
        at once, since it seems to have something of importance on
        board.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What makes you think so?”</span> said the Count.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have been watching it for the last hour,”</span> said
        the man. <span class="tei tei-q">“At first I thought it was a little
        trading vessel; but I noticed that as soon as it entered the Haven it
        hoisted the Labarum.”</span><a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53"
        href="#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Labarum!”</span> exclaimed the Count; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg
        248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>not
        seen that flying from any mast but my own for a year past. Well, that
        ought to mean something.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the
        etiquette to go as far as was possible to meet an Imperial messenger,
        just as a host receives a very distinguished guest on his door-step,
        and the Count, after hastily exchanging his hunting-dress for a toga,
        went to the little pier at which the galley would land its passenger.
        He had not to wait many minutes before it arrived, and a handsome
        young man, with a short military cloak over his traveller’s dress,
        leapt lightly ashore. The Count saluted. The stranger, who was for a
        time the representative of the Emperor, received the greeting with
        the dignified gesture of a superior.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Do I address Lucius Ælius, Count of the Saxon
        Shore?”</span> he asked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am he,”</span> the Count briefly replied.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I bring the commands of Augustus,”</span> said the
        messenger, producing from a pocket in his tunic a vellum roll, bound
        with a broad purple cord, and bearing the Imperial seal.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count received
        the missive with a profound inclination, and put it to his lips. At
        the same time the messenger uncovered, and changed his haughty
        demeanour for the behaviour usual to a young officer in the presence
        of his superior.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It will be more respectful and more convenient to read
        his Majesty’s gracious communication in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>private. Will you please come with me to my
        house?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He led the way to
        the villa, and introduced the visitor into the little room which he
        used for the transaction of business. He then cut with his dagger the
        purple cord which fastened the package containing the despatch, and,
        after again putting the document to his lips, proceeded to read it.
        Its contents were seemingly not agreeable, for his face darkened as
        he went on. He made no remark, however, beyond simply asking the
        messenger—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“May I presume that you have a general acquaintance with
        the contents of this document?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have,”</span> replied the young man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then you will know that the answer is not one which can
        be given in a moment. But,”</span> and he went on with a rapid change
        of voice and manner, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cras

        just on the point of going out for a few hours’ hunting when your
        arrival was announced. Will you come with me? I have nothing very
        great to show you, though we have some big game here too, if we had
        time to look for it, but if you will condescend to anything so small
        as hare-hunting, I can show you some sport.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Imperial
        messenger was an Italian of the north of the Peninsula, who had been
        fond of fol<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg
        250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>lowing the chase on the slopes of the Apennines
        before chance had made him a courtier. He accepted the invitation
        with pleasure, and the party made the best of their way to the high
        ground now known as Arreton Downs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah!”</span> said the Count, as he pointed northward to
        where the great Anderida Forest<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55"
        href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> might be
        seen stretching far beyond the range of sight, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“there is the place for sport; a wilder country I have
        never seen, no, nor finer game. There are wild boars of which I have
        never seen the like in Italy, no, nor in the Hercynian Wood<a id=
        "noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        where I used to hunt years ago. Last year I killed one which measured
        six feet from snout to tail. There are wolves, too, and bears, and
        wild oxen; splendid fellows these last, as fierce as lions, and
        almost as big as elephants. But to-day we must be content with
        humbler sport.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This humbler game,
        however, afforded plenty of amusement, and they returned with a bag
        of eight fine hares—a very fair burden for the carrier of the
        game-bag—and an excellent appetite for dinner.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The meal, to which
        the Count had invited the captains of his galleys and the principal
        persons in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg
        251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        little colony which was now gathered about the villa, passed off very
        well. The young Italian was loud in his praises of everything.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Your oysters,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“all the world knows, but some of your other dishes are a
        surprise. The turbot, for instance, how incomparably superior to the
        flabby and tasteless things which they bring us from our own coasts.
        The colder water of the seas is, I suppose, the cause. The hares,
        too, how fine and fleshy! You seem to be amazingly well off in the
        way of food in this corner of the world.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah!”</span> said the Count, with a sigh, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“we should do very well, if the rest of the world would
        only leave us alone. But our neighbours cannot be content without a
        share of some of our good things, and they have a very rough and
        disagreeable way of asking for it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The speaker went
        on to draw for the benefit of his guest a vivid picture of the
        trouble which the Saxons were giving by sea and the Picts by land,
        till the Italian exclaimed—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah! I see that you too have your disagreeables. I began
        to think that this was a land of peace and plenty, where one might
        find a pleasant refuge. But these barbarians, in one shape or
        another, are everywhere. We are fallen upon evil times
        indeed.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said the Count, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“evil times, and no one knows how to deal with them; and
        if God does <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg
        252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>send
        us a capable man, we treat him as if he were an enemy.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the tables
        had been cleared, the Count rose and proposed the toast of the
        Emperor’s health; but he did this without a single word of
        compliment, a significant omission that did not fail to attract the
        attention of all who were present. He then proceeded, and again
        without any preface, to read to the company the despatch which had
        been put into his hands the day before. It ran thus:</p>

        head and the limbs in the body of man, it is manifest that neither
        can prosper without the other. Our well-beloved and faithful province
        of Britain has now for many generations been protected by our
        invincible legions and fleets. But even as there comes a time when
        the most careful fathers judge it to be not only needless but even
        harmful to keep their children in dependence upon themselves, so do

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reading of the
        despatch was followed by a dead silence. Every one had felt for some
        time that the present state of affairs could not last. Only a man of
        the vigorous character of the Count, and having long years of
        excellent service to fall back upon, could have maintained it so
        long, but it was impossible not to see that it must soon end. A
        solitary commander, without resources or support, could not maintain
        himself on the remotest borders of the Empire. Yet to know that the
        moment for the change had come was disturbing. The fleet, reduced as
        it had been to a petty squadron, was still, while it remained, the
        symbol of Imperial power, and seemed to be worth more in the way of
        protection than <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg
        254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it
        really was. When this was withdrawn, Britain would be really left to
        itself; and this prospect, however it might be regarded elsewhere,
        was not agreeable to any one of the Count’s guests.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count was the
        first to break the silence. <span class="tei tei-q">“This,”</span> he
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">“is manifestly a matter that calls for
        serious thought. Let us postpone it till to-morrow, and for the
        present turn ourselves to matters more suitable for a festive
        occasion. Perhaps my friend Claudian will give us the recitation of
        something with which he has already charmed the ears of our
        fellow-countrymen elsewhere.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The poet, not more
        reluctant than his brother-countryman to exhibit his genius, at once
        signified his willingness to comply with this request, and gave a
        recitation from an unfinished poem which he had then in hand. We may
        give a specimen, put into the best English that we can command—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next morning
        the Count invited the Imperial messenger to a private conference. His
        daughter and Carna were present, as was also Claudian.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Pray let us have them. Here we know nothing.
        But tell us first how you got here. It was noticed that you did not
        hoist the standard till you were within the Haven. You did not, I
        suppose, think it a safe flag to sail under.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        "tei tei-q">“I thought it better to have no flag at all. But, to tell
        the truth, the Labarum is not just now exactly the best passport in
        the world.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You crossed from Gaul, I suppose?”</span> the Count went
        on. <span class="tei tei-q">“How are matters there?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Constantine, with the legions he brought from here, and
        those that have joined him since, is pretty well master of the

        provinces go without a struggle? Spain was the first province that
        Rome ever had, and Gaul was the second. None, I take it, have been so
        steadily profitable, and now we are to lose them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He rose from his

        which he had studiously banished all kind of emphasis, and looking as
        he spoke at the ceiling of the room, <span class="tei tei-q">“your
        lordship is aware that the honours thus unexpectedly bestowed do not
        always turn out to the advantage of those who receive

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh! he will be quiet for a time, or should be, if there

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No, indeed,”</span> replied the Count. <span class=

        year, a vague rumour that he was on the move again. But tell me—has
        Augustus given <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Not exactly; but I will tell what has taken place. He
        marched on Rome.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> interjected the Count, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and there was no Stilicho to save it!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The city was almost helpless. Even the walls had not
        been kept in repair, and if they had, there was no proper force to
        man them. The only thing possible was to make peace on the best terms
        that they could. I happened to be in Alaric’s camp with a letter,
        under a flag of truce, the very day that the ambassadors came out to
        treat with the king, and I saw the whole affair. I don’t mind saying
        that it was not one to make a man feel proud of being a Roman. The
        barbarians, it seemed to me, had not only all the strength on their
        side, but the dignity also. Alaric himself is a splendid specimen of
        humanity, every inch a king, the tallest and handsomest man in his
        army, and that, too, an army of giants. It was a contrast, I can tell
        you, between him and the two miserable, pettifogging creatures that
        represented the Senate. At first they tried what a little brag could
        do. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Give us an honourable peace,’</span>
        said their spokesman, <span class="tei tei-q">‘or you will repent of
        having driven to despair a nation of warriors, a nation that has
        conquered the world.’</span> The king laughed; he knew what the
        Romans have come to. <span class="tei tei-q">‘The thicker the
        hay,’</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘the easier to
        mow.’</span> And then he fixed the ransom that he would take for
        retiring from before the walls. Brennus throwing his sword into the
        scales was moderation in comparison to him. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Give <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg
        260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>me,’</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘all the gold and silver, coined or uncoined, private
        property or public that you have, and all the other property that the
        envoys whom I shall send think worth taking; and hand over to me all
        the slaves that you have of the nations of the North, Goths, or Huns,
        or Vandals. You are pleased to call them barbarians, but they are
        more fit to be masters than you; and I will not suffer them to be in
        a bondage so unworthy. Your Greeks, and Africans, and Asiatics, and
        such like cattle you may keep.’</span> The ambassadors were pale with
        dismay. If they had taken back such an answer, the Romans had at
        least enough spirit left to tear them in pieces. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘What do you leave us, then?’</span> they said.
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Your lives!’</span> he thundered out. In the
        end, however, he softened somewhat. Five thousand pounds of gold and
        thirty thousand pounds of silver, and I don’t know how much silk, and
        cloth, and spices, were what he finally asked. I know the city was
        stripped pretty bare before the Senate could make up the sum. I am
        told that the treasuries of the churches had to be emptied. Well, as
        I said, Alaric, if he keeps his bargain, ought to be quiet for a
        time, but you will see that the Emperor has need of all his friends
        round him, and all the strength which he can bring together. That is
        what I have to say by way of explanation of the despatch that I
        brought.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he had left

        thought that the day would come when I should feel ashamed of the
        title. But tell me, daughter; what shall we do? Shall we
        go?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What else can we do?”</span> asked the girl.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have thought much about the matter since I heard the
        dreadful news of Stilicho’s death, and have had all kinds of wild
        schemes in my head. I have felt that I could not go back and touch in
        friendship the hands that murdered him. Sometimes I thought, while
        Cedric was here, that we would take him with us, and sail eastward. I
        have had many a hard fight with these Saxons, but at least they are
        men, and brave men, too, who are true to their friends, if they hate
        their enemies. But that is now at an end. But is there no other way
        to go? What say you, Claudian—have you any counsel to give
        us?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I would not advise you to sail eastward,”</span> said
        the poet. <span class="tei tei-q">“We know pretty well what lies that
        way; tribes of barbarians, of whom the less we see the better, with
        all respect to your friend Cedric, who seems to have been a fine
        fellow. But why not westward? You will laugh at me for believing in
        the Islands of the Blest. Well, I do not mean to say that there is
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262"
        id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a country where Achilles and
        the rest of the heroes are living in immortal joy and peace. If there
        is, it is not one which any ship, built by the art of man, can reach.
        But I do believe that there is a country. These old tales, depend
        upon it, have something more in them than mere fancy. Why, my lord,
        should not you be the one to find it?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        Carna?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carna only smiled
        sadly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        "tei tei-q">“there is the land beyond the north, the country of the
        blessed Hyperboreans, that old Herodotus talks about. Why should we
        not go there? Or, if that sounds too wild, there is Africa, with
        regions rich and fertile beyond all doubt that are waiting to be
        explored. These at least are no matter of legend. We know where they
        are. Let us search for them. Whatever world we may find, it can

        upon his country. If I could reach the Islands of the Blest, or the
        happy people who live beyond the north, as easily as I can walk
        across this room, I would not do it; and after all, what is the world
        without Rome to a Roman? What say you, Claudian?”</span></p>

        Still, I go with you. It is not for a Roman to say that Rome is
        unworthy.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        love.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The girl lifted up
        a tear-stained face to him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Father,”</span> she said—<span class="tei tei-q">“more

        going to leave us for a husband?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The girl blushed
        crimson as she shook her head. When she could recover her speech,
        choked, as it was, with sobs, she said—</p>

        less myself? Rome is your country, and Britain is mine. And oh, if
        Rome wants all her sons and daughters, how much more does this poor
        Britain!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        the dreadful things you have gone through within the last few months!
        How can you bear to face them with your friends gone? And, dearest
        Carna,”</span> she went on, as she clasped her still closer,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“how can I live without you?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        doubt what my duty is. And I am not without hope. There are brave men
        here, and men who love their country, and I cannot but trust that
        they will be able to do something. Of course, we shall stumble, for
        we have not been used to go alone, but I do hope that we shall not
        fall altogether.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The resolution to
        return to Italy once made, the Count lost no time in carrying it out.
        His own preparations for departure did not cost him much trouble. He
        began by offering freedom to all the slaves in his household. The
        difficulty was in inducing them to accept it. So kind a master had he
        been—in spite of an occasional outburst of temper—and so uncertain
        were the prospects of a quiet life in Britain, that very few felt any
        eagerness to be independent, and the boon had to be forced upon them
        or made acceptable by a considerable bribe. With the free population
        that since the departure of the legions had gathered in increasing
        numbers about the villa it was still more difficult to deal. Many of
        them were quite helpless people whom it seemed equally difficult to
        take and to leave behind. To all that were of Italian birth, or that
        had kinsfolk or friends on the Continent who might be reasonably
        expected to give <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg
        267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>them
        a home, the Count offered a passage. For others employment was found
        in Londinium and other towns. But, when all that was possible had
        been done, there was a helpless remnant, about whom the Count felt
        much as the occupants of the last boat must feel at the sight of the
        poor creatures whom they are forced to leave behind on a sinking
        ship.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carna had quitted
        the villa very soon after her resolution to remain in Britain had
        been made. It was indeed too painful to remain there, for, though the
        Count had confessed that she was right, his daughter remained
        unconvinced, and assailed her with incessant entreaties and
        reproaches which went very near to breaking her heart. She made her
        home with the old priest whose wife was a distant kinswoman of her
        own, and found, as such tender hearts always will, a solace for her
        own sorrows in relieving the troubles of others.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About the middle
        of September all was ready for a start. The two serviceable ships
        that were left to the Count were loaded to their utmost capacity with
        the persons and property of the departing colony. Their sailing
        masters had indeed remonstrated as strongly as they dared.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">may</span></span> get safely across,”</span>
        said the senior of them, <span class="tei tei-q">“if all goes better
        than we have any right to expect. But if it comes on to blow we shall
        hardly be able to handle our ships; and if we meet with the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268"
        id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pirates—well, a man might as
        well go into battle with his hands tied.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Count refused
        to listen to these protests. Even the suggestion that the cargo
        should be divided, and part left for a second voyage he scouted,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“It will not do,”</span> he said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the poor people would fancy they were being
        left behind, and I am not at all sure that they would not be right.
        It is only too likely that if we once get to the other side we should
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></span> come back. No! we will sink or
        swim together.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About an hour
        before noon on the fifteenth of the month, the crews were ready to
        weigh anchor. The Count and his daughter, who had just taken their
        last view of the villa which had been their home for so many years,
        were standing on the little jetty, ready to step into the boat that
        was to convey them to the ship. Carna and the old priest and his wife
        were with them, and the hour of farewell had come. Ælia, if she had
        not reconciled herself to separation from her sister, at least saw
        that it was inevitable, and was resolved not to make the parting
        bitterer than it must needs be. She affected a cheerfulness which she
        did not feel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Good-bye, Carna,”</span> she cried, throwing her arms
        round the girl’s neck. <span class="tei tei-q">“Good-bye! now we are
        going like swallows in the autumn, and very likely shall come back
        like them in the spring. Meanwhile keep the nest as warm for us as
        you can.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg
        269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Remember, Carna,”</span> said the Count, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that you have a home as long as either I or my daughter
        have a roof over our heads. You are doing your duty in staying, but
        there is a limit even to duty. As long as you can be of service,
        stop; I would not have it otherwise; but don’t sacrifice yourself and
        those that love you for nothing.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carna’s heart was
        too full to let her speak. She caught the Count’s hands and kissed
        them. Then she turned to Ælia, and taking her gold cross and
        chain—the only ornament that she wore—hung it round her sister’s
        neck. When she had succeeded in choking down her sobs, she whispered,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Take this, and, if you will give me yours,
        we will bear each other’s crosses, and, perhaps, they will be a
        little lighter. But oh, how heavy!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Kneel, my children,”</span> said the old priest, and the
        little group knelt down, while the rowers in the boat uncovered their
        heads. After repeating the paternoster and a few simple words of
        prayer, he raised his hand and blessed them, then fell on his knees
        beside them. After two or three minutes of silent supplication the
        Count rose, and almost lifted his daughter into the boat, so broken
        down was she with the passion of her grief. Carna remained on her
        knees, her face buried in her hands. To have looked up and seen
        father and sister go was more than she dared to do. For the struggle
        that she fancied was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg
        270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>over
        had begun again in her heart, and she could not feel sure even then
        that duty would prevail. The Count gently laid his hand upon her head
        and blessed her, then stepped into the boat. As the rowers dipped
        their oars in the water, a gleam of sunshine burst through the
        clouds, and lighted as with a glory the head of the kneeling
        girl.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The little
        community that remained in the neighbourhood of the villa after the
        departure of the Count and his household had plenty to occupy their
        thoughts and hands. The Count had behaved with a liberality and a
        discretion that were both equally characteristic of him. All the
        stock of what may be called the home farm, all the agricultural
        implements, the cattle, sheep, and pigs, and as much of the stores of
        corn that he could spare, he had made over to the priest and two
        other principal persons in the settlement for the benefit of the
        community at large. This was an excellent start, and removed all
        immediate anxiety for the future. The stores of provisions had been
        increased by opportune purchases before the resolution to go had been
        taken, and enough was left to last, if managed with due economy, over
        the coming winter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carna found plenty
        of employment of the kind in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>which she found her greatest pleasure. There was
        indeed a terrible gap in her life; not only had she lost those whom
        she had loved all her life as father and sister, but her intellectual
        interests had dropped away from her. Many of the books at the villa
        had indeed been left with her, but then there was no one to whom to
        talk about them. The old priest never opened a volume except it was a
        service book; his wife could not even read. But the time never hung
        heavily upon her hands, for there was plenty of work to do among the
        sick and sorry. As the autumn went on an epidemic, which a modern
        doctor would probably have described as measles, broke out among the
        children, and Carna spent her days and nights in ministering to the
        little sufferers. The one relief that she allowed herself—and there
        was no little sadness mixed with the pleasure which it gave her—was
        to spend an hour, when she could snatch one from her many cares, in
        the deserted rooms of the villa. The indulgence was rare, not only
        because her leisure was infrequent, but because she was conscious of
        feeling somewhat relaxed after it for the effort of her daily life;
        but when it came it was precious. Not a room, not a picture on the
        walls, not a pattern in the tesselated pavements, that did not call
        up a hundred associations, and make the past in which she had enjoyed
        so much happiness live again in her fancy. The dwelling was under the
        charge of an old couple, who <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>gladly kept it clean in exchange for the shelter
        of two or three of the rooms, and Carna was free to wander about it
        as she would, while she felt a certain security in the knowledge that
        the place was not wholly deserted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The autumn and
        winter passed without any incident of importance. News from the
        Continent had never been very regular during that season of the year,
        and now it came only at the rarest intervals. All that the settlement
        heard went to show that there was but little chance of the return of
        the legions. Constantine, after some changes of fortune, had made
        himself master of Gaul and Spain, and had established a kingdom which
        looked so much as if it might last, that he had been regularly
        acknowledged by Honorius as a partner in the Empire. But it would be
        long before he could spare money or men for adding Britain to his
        dominions. From Britain itself the news was mostly of the most dismal
        kind. The Picts, indeed, were not as troublesome as usual. Happily
        for their neighbours on the south, their attention had been occupied
        by the tribes on the north, who had been driven by a season of
        unusual scarcity to forage for themselves. The robbers, in fact, had
        been obliged to defend themselves against being robbed, and Britain
        had had in consequence a quiet time. But the people used it to
        quarrel among themselves. There were scores of chiefs who had each
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274"
        id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his pedigree, by which he
        traced his lineage to some king of the pre-Roman days, and which gave
        him, he fancied, a title to rule over his neighbours. And besides
        these personal jealousies, there was a great division which split the
        nation into two hostile factions. There were Britons, who held to
        Roman ways, and among them, to the religion which Rome had given, and
        there were Britons who looked back to the old independent days, and
        to the faith which their fore-fathers had held long before the name
        of Christ had been heard out of or in the land of His birth. The
        former party was by far the more numerous, but its adherents were
        those who had suffered most by Britain’s four centuries of servitude;
        in the latter the virtues of freedom had been kept alive by a
        carefully cherished tradition. They were few in number; but they were
        vigorous and enthusiastic, even fanatical. It was clear that this
        strife within would cause at least as much trouble as would come from
        enemies without.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was about seven
        months after the Count’s departure when Carna paid one of her
        customary visits to the villa. She had been unusually busy for three
        or four weeks previously, and had not found time to come. As she
        passed through the garden, on her way to the house, she noticed that
        the place looked somewhat neater and less neglected than usual. This,
        however, did not surprise her, as she had gently remonstrated with
        the old keeper for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg
        275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>doing so little, and, in her usual kindly way,
        had followed up her reproof with a little present. Accordingly she
        passed on without thinking more of the matter to the little
        sitting-room which she had once shared with Ælia, and prepared to
        spend an hour of quiet enjoyment with a book. Her books, indeed, she
        kept for these visits to the villa. Not only was her time elsewhere
        closely occupied, but her hostess, kindly and affectionate as she
        generally was, could not conceal her dislike of the volumes which
        Carna loved so dearly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the midst of
        her reading she was startled by the unaccustomed sound of footsteps.
        She lifted her eyes from the page and saw a sight so unexpected that
        for a few moments she could not collect her thoughts or believe her
        eyes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The British chief
        Martianus stood before her.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She had seen him
        last at the Great Temple, and the recollections of those days and
        nights of horror, her capture, her hurried journey, and the
        interrupted sacrifice, crowded upon her, and almost overpowered her.
        Nor could she help giving one thought to the question—if this man’s
        presence recalls such horrors in the past, what does it not mean for
        the future? Still, the courage which had supported her so bravely
        before did not fail her now. She rose from her seat and calmly faced
        the intruder, while she waited for him to speak.</p><span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Martianus began in
        a tone of the deepest respect. <span class="tei tei-q">“Lady, I am
        truly glad that you condescend to honour this poor house of mine with
        your presence.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This house of yours!”</span> repeated the girl, with
        astonishment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Lady, doubtless you do not know that this villa was
        built by its former owner on land which belonged to my family, and
        which was taken from them by force. I do not speak of the Count—he
        was too honourable a man to do anything of the kind—I speak of the
        former owner, or so-called owner, from whom he purchased it. In the
        Count’s time I said nothing of my claim. I would not have troubled
        him for the world. But now that he has gone, and practically given up
        the place, I am justified, I think, in asserting my
        ownership.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I know nothing of these matters,”</span> said Carna,
        coldly, <span class="tei tei-q">“but I will take care not to intrude
        again.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Intrusion!”</span> said the chief. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Did I not say that there is no one who would be more
        welcome here? We were friends once, in the good Count’s time; why
        should we not be so again? and more,”</span> he added in a
        whisper.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Friends with you! Surely that is impossible. You cannot
        wish it yourself, after what has happened. You seem to

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        villains, Carausius and Ambiorix. Believe me, it was against my will
        that I took any part in that dreadful business. And you will remember
        I never lifted a hand against you, no, nor against that base champion
        of yours. You will do me that justice. Carausius, thank Heaven! has

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carna remained
        silent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Martianus resolved
        to try another appeal, and, presuming that the girl’s recollections
        of the scene might be confused by fear, did not scruple to depart
        considerably from the truth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I implore you to believe that I could not have allowed
        that horrible deed to be accomplished. If that base fellow who had
        the privilege of saving you had not appeared, I was ready myself to
        interfere. I know that I ought to have done so before; it has been a
        ceaseless regret to me that I did not. But I wanted to keep on terms
        with those two, and I held back till the last moment. Forgive me my
        irresolution, Carna, but do not believe that I could have been one of
        the murderers.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The girl’s
        recollections of the scene, which were quite free from the confusion
        which Martianus had imagined, did not agree with this account of his
        behaviour, but she did not think it worth while to argue the
        point.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg
        278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let it be as you will,”</span> she said, with a cold
        dignity, <span class="tei tei-q">“but you can imagine that these
        recollections are not pleasing to me. And now I will bid you
        farewell.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She stepped
        forward as she spoke with the intention of at once leaving the room,
        but Martianus barred the way. Dropping on one knee, he caught her
        hand. For a moment Carna, who had still something of the child in
        her, felt a strong impulse to use the hand that was still free in
        dealing him a vigorous blow. But her womanly dignity prevailed: she
        only wrenched her hand away with something like violence. There was
        something in the foppish appearance and insincere manner of Martianus
        that set her more decidedly against him than even the recollection of
        the plot in which he had been concerned.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I will listen to what you have to say, but do not touch
        me.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You give me little encouragement,”</span> Martianus
        began, <span class="tei tei-q">“but still I will speak. I say nothing
        about myself, only about my country—your country and mine. I know how
        you love it. We have all heard what sacrifices you have made for it,
        how you gave up home and friends sooner than leave it. Make, if I
        must put it so, one sacrifice more. You are the heiress of the great
        Caradoc, the noblest king that Britain ever had, whom even the Romans
        were com<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name=
        "Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pelled to admire. I can
        reckon among my ancestors Cunobelin. Apart our claims might be
        disputed; together they will make a title which no one can dispute to
        the crown of Britain. Yes, Carna, it is nothing less than that—the
        crown of Britain that is in question.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A crown does not tempt me,”</span> said Carna, looking
        the speaker straight in the face.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah! it is not that,”</span> replied the suitor;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“you mistake me. I never dreamed of tempting
        you. I know only too well that it would be impossible. But think what
        a British crown really means. It means a united Britain, strong
        against the Picts, strong against the Saxons; and without it—think
        what that would mean. Every tribe—for we should split up into tribes
        again—for itself; every chief working for his own hand; the Picts
        plundering the inland, the Saxons harrying the coast. Oh, Carna! as
        you love your country—I don’t speak of myself, though that, too,
        might come in time, if a man’s devotion is of any avail—but if you
        love your country, do not say no.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a powerful
        appeal, and touched Carna’s heart at the point where it was most
        accessible. And she was so candid and transparent a soul that what
        she felt in her heart she soon showed in her face.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Martianus saw his
        advantage, but, happily for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg
        280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Carna, did not press it as he might have done.
        The fact was that he was so conscious of his own insincerity and
        falsehood that his courage failed him, and he dared not press his
        suit any further. Had he gone on, he might have entangled the girl in
        a promise which her feeling for truth would not have permitted her to
        break, which would have made her even shut her eyes to the truth. As
        it was, he thought it his best policy to rest content with the
        progress that he had made. He raised Carna’s hand respectfully to his
        lips, and, with a low salutation, opened the door.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a fact that
        Martianus had taken possession of the villa in the island, on the
        strength of a claim which was far less definite than he had chosen to
        represent to Carna. But no other owner was forthcoming, and the place
        was important in the minds of the British population as having been
        the dwelling of the last representative of Roman power. The new
        occupant might seem to have succeeded to the position of the one who
        had lately quitted it. It flattered the man’s vanity, too, to put
        himself in the place, so to speak, of the powerful Count of the
        Shore, while he could use the appliances of the villa, which were
        comfortable and even luxurious, to gratify his taste for what he
        called the pleasures of civilized life. His establishment would
        probably have failed to satisfy the fastidious taste of a Roman
        gentleman; the cooking was barbarous, and the service generally rude.
        Still there was a certain imitation, which im<span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>posed at least upon the ignorant, of Roman
        refinement, and Martianus flattered himself that he was at least a
        passable successor of Count Ælius.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile he
        pursued his suit to Carna with a good deal of craft. He was a
        diligent attendant at the village church, and professed to feel such
        an interest in the teaching of the old priest that the ministrations
        in church must be supplemented by conversations at home. To Carna he
        said little or nothing about his personal claims, but he was eloquent
        on the subject of the future of Britain. About this she was never
        tired of hearing, and in hearing him speak of it, which he did with a
        certain eloquence, the sense of his falseness and unreality began to
        grow fainter in her mind. The maiden faith which <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“glorifies clown and satyr”</span> began to make this
        schemer, who indeed was not without ability and accomplishments, look
        like a genuine patriot. As for the priest and his wife, they were
        simply captivated by him, and never lost an opportunity of praising
        him to their young kinswoman. On the whole, his suit made some
        progress. It was only when he seemed to put forward any personal
        claim, or ventured to address to Carna any personal compliments, that
        she decidedly shrank from him. He was quite shrewd enough to see
        this, and though it was a very unpleasant experience for his vanity
        as well as for his love, he did not fail to guide his con<span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>duct by it. As long as he talked about
        Britain, its wrongs in the past, and its hopes for the future, he was
        sure of a favourable hearing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Martianus had
        other things to think of besides his suit to Carna. As he said, he
        had broken entirely with Ambiorix. He had found that the strength of
        the old Druid party had been greatly exaggerated, and that in fact
        the time for its revival had gone by for ever. Any chance, too, of
        even temporary success that it might have had had been lost with the
        life of Carausius. The priest had held many threads of secret
        intrigue in his hands, and there was no one to take them up, when
        they dropped from his hand. And Ambiorix, besides being worth but
        little as an ally, had wanted too much, for he was not of a temper to
        be satisfied with the second place.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still Martianus
        was well aware that his rival would have to be reckoned with sooner
        or later. If he could induce Carna to become his wife, and thus unite
        her family claim to his own, this reckoning might be got through with
        care and success. If he had to rely upon himself the chances would be
        decidedly less favourable. The dilemma in which he found himself was
        this. On the one hand, to hasten his suit might be to ruin it
        altogether; Carna, too, might fairly ask him for something more
        substantial than his own assertion of his pretensions. On the other
        hand, there was the danger of being <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>attacked and crushed before he could make his
        appeal to the country. Ambiorix, he knew, was a man of even desperate
        courage, and would not suffer himself to be effaced without a
        struggle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Martianus did his
        best to guard himself against this danger. He strengthened the
        fortifications which the Count had made round the villa, laid up a
        store of provisions which might be sufficient for a prolonged siege,
        and used all his resources—he was one of the richest men in
        Britain—to get together as large and effective a garrison as
        possible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These precautions
        were not taken a day too soon. About the beginning of June he
        received intelligence from his agents on the mainland that Ambiorix
        was preparing to attack him. He hurried at once with the news to the
        priest’s house.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You know,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
        my house has always been at your disposal, but, much as I should have
        liked to receive you as my guests, I would not press the invitation
        upon you. But now, in the face of what I have just heard, your coming
        is a necessity. Ambiorix and his followers are almost on the way to
        attack us, and there is no place of safety but the villa.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The proposition
        was most distasteful to Carna, who shuddered at the thought of
        entering her old home in such society. At first she was disposed to
        be generally incredulous, knowing that Martianus <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was not incapable of exaggerating, and
        even of inventing, when he had an object to serve. Compelled, by the
        proofs which the chief advanced, to acknowledge that the danger was
        real, she took refuge in the argument that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“it did not concern them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We are too insignificant to be harmed,”</span> she
        said.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pardon me, Carna,”</span> replied Martianus.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“You surely know better than that about
        yourself. And if, as I can easily believe, you are careless on your
        own account, think of your host. There is nothing that Ambiorix hates
        with so deadly a hatred as a Christian priest.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old priest, a
        worthy man, but not of the stuff of which martyrs are made, was
        terribly alarmed at this statement. Carna, too, was compelled to
        acknowledge that this fear was not without reason, and reluctantly
        consented to the removal. Her mind once made up, she found abundance
        of occupation in making it as little grievous to others as might be.
        The villa could not hold any great number of inmates in addition to
        the garrison, and of course it was necessary that the number of
        non-combatants should be as small as possible. Some of the
        inhabitants of the settlement could, of course, remain safely in
        their homes. They had little or nothing to be robbed of, and the
        expected assailants had no <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg
        286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>other reason for harming them. But many
        households had to be broken up, and as only very few could be
        received at the villa, there were many painful scenes to be gone
        through, and Carna was unceasingly busy giving all the comfort and
        help that she could. Martianus, who was not unkindly in temper, put
        all his resources at her disposal, and his readiness to assist put
        him higher in her favour than he had ever been before.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor was she sorry
        that she had found shelter within the fortifications of the villa
        when the next morning revealed the presence of the invaders. They had
        come across in the night to the number of several hundreds, and could
        be seen from the windows of the villa. And a very singular sight they
        were. A spectator might have imagined himself to have been carried
        back more than four centuries and a half, and to be looking on the
        hosts which had gathered to oppose the landing of the first Cæsar.
        These warriors who came up shouting to the palisade which formed the
        outer defence of the villa seemed to be absolute barbarians; no one
        could have believed that for many generations they had been subjects
        of a civilized power. They had, in fact, deliberately thrown off all
        the signs of that subjection. It was the dream of Ambiorix to have
        Britain such as she might have been had Rome never conquered her. It
        was a hopeless attempt, this rolling back the course <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of time by four centuries, but in such
        matters as dress and equipment something could be done. Accordingly,
        his troops were such as the troops of Cassibelan might have been had
        they suddenly risen from their graves. Most of them were naked to the
        waist; what clothing they had was chiefly of skins, though some wore
        gaily-coloured trews. All wore their hair falling over their
        shoulders, and long, drooping moustaches, but no beard or whisker.
        All the exposed parts of their bodies were dyed a deep indigo-blue,
        by the application of woad. Ambiorix had been very anxious to revive
        the chariots of his ancestors, but had been compelled to give up the
        idea. In any case he could not have transported them to the island.
        He had been at great pains to instruct them in the genuine British
        war-cries, as far as tradition had preserved them. Here, again, the
        result had been somewhat disappointing. There were things which they
        had learnt from Rome which they could not put off as easily as their
        dress; and the challenges which they shouted out to the besieged as
        they surged up to the defences were a curious mixture of the British
        and Latin tongues.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The battle at
        first went decidedly against the assailants. The Count had left
        behind him a catapult among other effects which he had not thought it
        worth while to remove; and Martianus, who had practised some of the
        garrison in the use of it, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg
        288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>brought it <a name="corr288" id="corr288" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">into</span> play with
        considerable effect. The very first discharge killed one of the
        lesser chiefs, and a little later in the day Ambiorix himself was
        badly bruised by one of the stones propelled from it. Meanwhile the
        defenders escaped almost wholly without injury. There was no need for
        them to leave the shelter of the buildings. As long as they kept
        within this the bows and slings of the enemy failed to harm them. One
        or two rash young recruits exposed themselves unnecessarily, and were
        wounded in consequence; but when Ambiorix, about an hour before
        sunset, called off his men, the garrison found that the casualties
        had been very slight and few.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the night
        the besiegers were not idle. They constructed a mantelet<a id=
        "noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a> of
        wicker work covered with stout hides, and brought it out close to the
        palisade—an operation which the besieged, with a culpable
        carelessness, allowed them to do unmolested. From under cover of this
        they plied long poles, armed at the ends with blades of steel (for
        Ambiorix was not so obstinate a conservative as to go back to the axe
        of bronze), and hacked away at the palisade. The catapult produced no
        effect on this erection, and though arrows, discharged almost
        perpendicularly into the air so as to fall just <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>on the other side of it, inflicted some
        injury, the work went on without interruption. Martianus, seeing
        this, headed a sally in person, and, after a sharp struggle,
        succeeded in possessing himself of it. The wicker work was broken in
        pieces, and the hides carried off within the line of defences.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next three
        days passed without incident, and the inmates of the villa began to
        hope that the danger had passed over. In reality, however, the
        besiegers were collecting materials for the construction of another
        mantelet on a much larger scale. As much of this as was possible was
        put together out of sight of the villa, and on the morning of the
        fourth day an erection of considerable size could be seen about fifty
        yards from the palisade. It soon became evident that the new plan of
        the assailants was to try the effect of fire. Arrows were wrapped
        round with tow, and, when this had been lighted, were discharged into
        the enclosure. Some mischief was done, not so much to the buildings,
        for it was not difficult to put out the fire if the arrows happened
        to fall on an inflammable place, but to the garrison. The men who had
        to extinguish the flames could not avoid exposing themselves, and
        those who exposed themselves were frequently hit by the slingers and
        archers. On the whole, however, little progress was made, and when,
        in the course of the evening, a heavy rain came on, and the wind,
        which had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg
        290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>hitherto assisted the flames, altogether died
        away, the discharge ceased.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was now
        necessary for Ambiorix to bring matters to a crisis. His followers
        had nearly exhausted the store of provisions which they had brought
        with them, and, as he was unwilling to alienate the inhabitants of
        the island by resorting to plunder, he did not see how he could
        replenish it. Nothing remained, therefore, but to try a direct
        assault, and this he did in the early dawn of the sixth day after his
        arrival. Under cover of a heavy mist which rolled in from the sea,
        and helped by the neglect of the sentinels, who, never very watchful,
        had relaxed their care altogether when the light became visible, he
        brought his men close up to the palisade at the spot where an opening
        had been left, closed with a strong gate. For a few minutes, such was
        the supineness of the garrison, the assailants were allowed to batter
        and hew at this undisturbed. When some of the defenders had been
        rallied to the spot, the work was more than half done. Ambiorix, who
        was now entirely recovered from the injury received on the first day
        of the siege, plied his axe with extraordinary energy, and his
        immediate followers, whom he had carefully selected for their courage
        and strength, followed his example. By the time Martianus arrived on
        the scene the gate had been broken down, and the assailants were
        pouring into the enclosure.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The garrison, who
        were outnumbered in the proportion of nearly three to one, were at
        once ordered to fall back into the quadrangle of the villa. They
        formed a line across the open side where they were covered by the
        archers and slingers posted on the roofs of the various buildings.
        Here a long and fierce struggle ensued. The defenders had some
        advantage in their position, and were better drilled and disciplined;
        the assailants, on the other hand, had the courage of fanaticism.
        When an hour had passed, and the combatants, by mutual consent,
        paused to take breath, both sides had lost many in killed and
        wounded, but neither had gained any considerable advantage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carna meanwhile
        had been busy ministering to the needs of the wounded, and was
        scarcely aware of the true position of affairs, the room in which she
        was at work not commanding a view of the space in which the struggle
        was going on. Chancing, however, to leave it for a moment in search
        of something which she wanted for her work, she saw what had taken
        place. In a moment her resolution was taken. During the siege her
        thoughts had been taken up, not with the danger to herself and the
        other inmates of the villa, but with the terrible fact that Britons
        were fighting against Britons. Long before she would have attempted
        to put an end to their cruel strife, if she had seen any hope of
        success. She would not have hesitated risking her life in the
        attempt. In<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg
        292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>deed
        she had proposed to Martianus that she should go with a party bearing
        a flag of truce, and seek an interview with the hostile commander. He
        had met her with a courteous and peremptory refusal, and she had been
        compelled to acquiesce. But now it seemed to her that her chance was
        come. Taking advantage of the pause in the struggle, she ran between
        the combatants, and threw herself on her knees with her face towards
        the assailants.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A murmur of
        astonishment and admiration ran through both the ranks. She seemed to
        be a visitor from another world, so strange, so unexpected, and, at
        the same time, so beautiful was her appearance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Britons, brothers,”</span> she cried, in a sweet but
        penetrating voice, which made itself heard through the throng,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“what is this? Britons, brothers, have you
        forgotten what you are? Your masters have left you. You carry arms
        which have been forbidden to you for more than four hundred years,
        and must you first use them against your own countrymen? Have you no
        enemies abroad that you must look for them at home?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A shriek of
        terror, followed by a wild war cry, which, though strange to many of
        the crowd, was only too familiar to the dwellers on the coast, gave a
        fearful emphasis to her words. The enemies from without were
        there.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cedric, after
        making good his escape from the villa, as has been related, had
        nearly died of hunger on the shore to which he had managed to make
        his way. When he was almost at his last gasp, a Saxon galley had
        touched at the very spot to supply itself with water. Fortunately for
        him it was commanded by a kinsman of his own, who persuaded the
        crew—the Saxon adventurers had to be dealt with by persuasion rather
        than by command—to return home with their passenger. This probably
        saved his life; his mother, a skilful leech, whose fame was spread
        abroad among the dwellers on the coast, nursed him back into health.
        Still he had suffered long and much; and it was not till the summer
        was far advanced that he was allowed to join an expedition. His noble
        birth, his reputation for strength and courage, not a little
        enhanced, of course, by his late escape, and the personal fascination
        that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name=
        "Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he exercised on all
        about him, pointed him out, young as he was, for command.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Carna had been
        unceasingly in his thoughts since the day when he had last seen her.
        During the delirium of his illness her name had been continually on
        his lips, and one of the earliest confidences of his recovery was the
        story of his love for this Christian maiden of the west. His mother
        was touched by the story. The girl’s passionate desire for the
        welfare of the son that was dead (which she appreciated without
        comprehending its motive), and the very heroism which the son that
        was living had shown in defending her, combined to move her heart.
        That any living woman could resist the attraction of such a champion
        as her son, she did not believe for a moment, in spite of all that
        Cedric could say about the height of saintliness on which Carna
        stood; and by degrees the young chief himself found his worshipping
        devotion mingled with hopes that were very sweet to his heart.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
        surprising, therefore, that as soon as he was at sea, and the
        destination of their voyage became a question, his thoughts at once
        turned to the island. Approaching it with caution, for he was too
        good a leader to risk an encounter with the superior force of the
        Roman squadron, he learnt with surprise that the Count had departed.
        Of Carna his informant, a fisherman who found it answer his purpose
        to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name=
        "Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>give what information
        he could to the Saxons, could tell him nothing, and Cedric naturally
        supposed that she had gone with the family into which she had been
        adopted. The news struck a strange chill into his heart, but at the
        same time it relieved him of considerable perplexity. His course was
        now clear; if the Romans were gone there was nothing to be feared. He
        knew the approaches to the villa, and how weak were its defences, and
        he felt sure that a British garrison would not be a match for his own
        vigorous Saxons.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He reached the
        island two days after the landing of Ambiorix. Acting as his own spy
        on the strength of his knowledge of the country, he soon found out
        the position of affairs, and thought that he could not do better than
        wait to see how things would turn out. The galleys—Cedric had two
        under his command—lay in hiding at some little distance from the
        Haven, and meanwhile every detail of the struggle was watched,
        unknown to the combatants, by scouts who carried news of its progress
        to their chief. The gathering of the troops previous to the attack on
        the fortifications had been observed and rightly understood by these
        men. Cedric had been at once informed of what was in progress, had
        landed his crews, amounting in all to about two hundred, and marched
        with all the speed that was possible to the scene of action. As the
        news had reached him not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg
        296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>long
        after midnight he was able to reach the spot very soon after the
        attack had commenced.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The battle-cry of
        the Saxons, terrible to those who knew it, scarcely less terrible,
        with its shrillness and fierceness, to those to whom it was strange,
        arrested the attention of all, and made every eye turn to the rear of
        the attacking party. There could be seen, running swiftly up the
        ascent which led to the palisade, the band of Saxons. In front a huge
        standard-bearer carried a blood-red banner, on which was wrought in
        black the raven of Odin. Behind him came, in a loose order which
        served to conceal their scanty number, Cedric’s warriors, a sturdy
        race, whose tall stature was made to seem almost gigantic by the
        height to which their hair was dressed. They were formidable foes,
        but still there were brave men in both the British parties who would
        have had the courage to stand up against them. Unhappily one of the
        panics which defy all reason and all individual courage began among
        the inland Britons at the sight of these strange enemies; and, once
        begun, it could not be checked. Ambiorix, indeed, with a few of his
        immediate followers, faced the enemy, but was quickly swept away by
        the rush of their onset. Martianus, with some of the garrison,
        carrying Carna along with him, took refuge in the villa, and hastily
        secured the doors. Others fled wildly over the country, or hid
        themselves in the out-buildings. Nowhere was <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>there any thought of resistance, and the Saxons
        won their victory almost without losing a drop of blood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cedric’s eyes,
        sharpened as they were by love, had caught a glimpse of Carna, as she
        was swept in the throng of fugitives within the doors of the villa,
        and he at once led his men to the attack. Any defence of the place
        against assailants so determined would have been hopeless, even had
        the garrison been as resolute as they were, in fact, feeble and
        demoralized. A few sturdy blows from Cedric’s battle-axe brought the
        principal door to the ground, and he rushed across the fragments into
        the hall, followed by some ten of his attendants. The rest he had
        signed to remain without. Carna, who, herself undismayed amidst all
        the tumult, was surrounded by a group of terrified men and women,
        stood facing him. The crimson mounted to her forehead as she met his
        eyes, for she saw, as no woman could fail to see, the love that was
        in them; but she showed no other sign of emotion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Spare these poor creatures,”</span> she said, pointing
        to her terrified companions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Your lives are safe,”</span> said Cedric in British.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Go with this <a name="corr297" id="corr297"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=
        "tei tei-corr">man,</span>”</span> and he pointed to one of his
        attendants, to whom at the same time he gave some brief directions.
        He turned to Carna: <span class="tei tei-q">“Lady,”</span> he said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“this is no time for many words; and I could
        not say them if it were, for my tongue is ill-taught in your
        language. But you cannot have failed to see <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>my heart. It is yours, and all that I have. Come
        and be a queen in my home and among my people.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The girl’s eyes,
        which she had turned to the ground at his first address, were now
        lifted to meet his gaze. <span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot leave my
        people,”</span> she said.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yet,”</span> he answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        good women of whom you used to tell me, whose lives are written in
        that holy book of yours, left their own people to follow their
        husbands.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, but the God of the husbands whom they followed was
        the God whom they worshipped in their own homes. You worship strange
        gods, with whom I can have no fellowship.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come with me and teach the truth to my people and
        me,”</span> cried the young man, feeling that there was nothing which
        he would not do to win this bright, brave, beautiful maiden.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Listen, Cedric,”</span> she answered—it was the first
        time that she had called him by his name, and he thought that he had
        never known before what a name it was—<span class="tei tei-q">“You
        told me some time since that you would sooner go into the everlasting
        darkness with your own people than bow the knee to a God whom you
        believed to have dealt unjustly with them. It was a noble resolve;
        and I have honoured you for it. Will you give it up for the love of a
        woman? If you did, I could honour you no more, and you are too good
        to have a wife that did not honour you. No, Cedric, I <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>will pray for you. Perhaps God will hear
        me, and give you light, and bring us together to the blessed Christ,
        but it cannot be here.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She caught his
        right hand which he had reached out in the earnestness of his
        speaking, and lifted it to her lips. Her kiss was the last expression
        of her gratitude. And perhaps there was something in it of a woman’s
        love. But she never faltered for one instant in the resolve that was
        to separate them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Behind Cedric
        stood a burly, middle-aged warrior, his father’s foster-brother. He
        had watched the scene with an intense interest, and though of course
        he could not understand what was said, had a very shrewd notion of
        the turn which affairs were taking. Perhaps he saw, too, expressed in
        the girl’s tone something of a feeling which the young man was too
        rapt in his adoration to observe. Anyhow, he was ill-content that his
        young chief should miss the bride on whom his heart was set, and who
        seemed so worthy of him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A noble maiden!”</span> he whispered to Cedric,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and fit to be the wife and mother of kings;
        and I think that she loves you. Shall we carry her off? I warrant
        that it will not be long before she forgives us.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Peace!”</span> said Cedric, turning fiercely upon him,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Peace! Would you have me wed a slave? My
        wife must come to me freely, or come not at
        all.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He spoke to Carna
        again. <span class="tei tei-q">“Your will is my law. If you say that
        we must part, I go. But, lady, you must leave this house. My people
        are set upon burning it, and I could not hinder them, if I
        would.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without another
        word, she obeyed his bidding, and passed into the court, followed by
        Cedric and his attendants.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile some of
        the Saxon crews had been busy with their torches, and the flames were
        beginning to gain a mastery over the building. Before many minutes
        had passed the sheds and outbuildings, which were, to a great extent,
        constructed of wood, were in a blaze, while dense volumes of smoke
        rolled out of the windows of the villa itself. Carna stood spellbound
        by the sight, at once so terrible and so grand. The spectacle of a
        burning house exercises a curious fascination even on those for whom
        it means loss and disaster, and Carna, even in that supreme crisis of
        her life, could not help gazing at the conflagration, and even
        admiring unconsciously the splendid contrasts of light and darkness
        which it produced.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seemed as if
        that day was about to sweep away all her past. She had torn from her
        heart her half-acknowledged love; she saw the home of her childhood
        and youth vanishing into smoke and ashes; and now another actor in
        the bygone of her life was to disappear for ever.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Martianus had
        observed the scene from the chamber in which he had taken refuge, and
        had misunderstood it. He fancied that the girl, whom, though no
        formal betrothal had bound her to him, he regarded as his own, was
        going of her own accord with this Saxon robber, in whom, of course,
        he recognized the champion who had saved her life at the Great
        Temple. The thought stung him to madness. With all his foppery and
        frivolity, he had the courage of his race. He might probably have
        escaped unnoticed from the burning building. But, disdaining flight,
        he rushed at Cedric, heedless of the odds which he was
        challenging.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chief’s
        followers, knowing their master’s temper, stood aside to let the
        conflict be decided without their interference. It was fierce, but it
        was brief. Martianus was a skilled swordsman, but a life of
        indolence, if not of excess, had slackened his sinews and unsteadied
        his nerves. He parried some of his antagonist’s blows with sufficient
        adroitness, but his defence grew weaker and weaker, and he could not
        save himself from one or two severe wounds. Giving way before the
        fierce, unremitting attack of his antagonist, he came without knowing
        it to the edge of the well, stumbled over the raised parapet that
        surrounded it, and fell headlong into its depths.<a id="noteref_62"
        name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sight of the
        conflict had diverted Carna’s attention from the burning house. She
        did not wait to see its issue, but at once quitted the precincts of
        the villa. Some of the survivors of the garrison, the old priest and
        his wife, and the rest of the non-combatants, followed her. Not only
        did they feel that it was she who had saved them from the swords of
        the Saxons, but they recognized in her calmness and courage the
        qualities of a true leader, and were sure that they could not do
        better than follow her guidance. Her own plans had been formed for
        some time. She saw that the strength of Britain was in the great
        cities. If the country, disorganized as it was, was to be made
        capable again of order and self-defence, the impulse must come from
        them, the centres of its civil and religious life. Londinium, where
        the Count’s name was well-known and respected, and where she had some
        connections of her own, was her destination. There she hoped to be
        able to do something for her people.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first step was
        to leave the neighbourhood of the villa, and with the helpless
        companions who now, she saw, looked to her for guidance, to make her
        way to the north of the island, and from thence to the mainland.
        Making a short pause till the stragglers had come up, she addressed a
        few words of counsel and comfort to the fugitives.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Dear friends,”</span> she said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“God has delivered us <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page303">[pg 303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>from the hands of the heathen, and will bring us
        safe to the haven where we would be. But this is no place for us. We
        will go to where we may serve Him in peace and quietness.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her clear, firm
        tones, which seemed inspired with all the confidence of an
        unfaltering faith, seemed to breathe in their turn new courage into
        the terrified crowd. They received them with a murmur of assent, and
        without an expression of fear or doubt, followed her as she led the
        way to the summit of the neighbouring downs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Arrived at this
        spot, she paused and turned, as if to take a last look at the scenes
        in which her past life had been spent. The landscape lay calm and
        smiling about her. Every feature in it was familiar to her eyes;
        there was not one with which she had not some happy association. But
        now the sight had lost its power; her soul was occupied with more
        profound emotions. The home of her childhood lay beneath her feet, a
        blackened ruin; and there, upon the sea, could be seen flashing in
        the sunlight the oars of the Saxons’ departing galleys.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a contrast
        full of significance, and the girl, in whose pure and enthusiastic
        soul there seemed to be something of a prophetic power, caught some
        of its meaning. That ruined house was the past, the days of the Roman
        domination. It had had its uses, it had done its work, but it had
        become corrupt and feeble, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg
        304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and
        it was passing away for ever. And the future was there, symbolized in
        the Saxon ships that, brightened by the sunshine, were speeding their
        way, instinct, as it seemed, with a vigorous and hopeful life, across
        the waters. That was the new power that was to shake this worn-out
        civilization, and raise in the course of the ages a fair fabric of
        its own.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the moment the
        present, with all its misery and desolation, mastered the girl’s
        spirit with an overpowering sense of loss. Thoughts of her ruined
        home, her helpless country, and her own personal loss, though almost
        unacknowledged to herself, in the final parting with the young hero
        of her life, came upon her with a force which broke down all her
        fortitude. She covered her face with her hands and wept.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then her fortitude
        and her conscience reasserted themselves. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Courage, my friends,”</span> she cried, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“God hath not deserted us, nor our dear country. We have
        sinned much, and we shall have much to bear. But He has chosen this
        land for a great work, and He will make all things work together for
        good till He has accomplished it.”</span> She was silent for a few
        moments. When she began to speak again, some mighty inspiration
        seemed to carry her beyond the present and out of herself.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> she cried, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“God hath great things in store for this dear
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305"
        id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>country of ours. I see a great
        blackness of darkness. From many houses, great and fair, where the
        rulers of the land lived delicately, shall go up to heaven the smoke
        of a great burning, and the fields shall be untilled and desolate,
        and the rivers shall run red with blood. But beyond the darkness I
        see a light, and the light shines upon a land that is fair as the
        garden of the Lord; and therein I behold great cities thronged with
        men, and in the midst of them stately houses of God, such as have
        never yet been built by skill of human hand. And the people that work
        and worship there are not of our race, nor yet wholly strange. For
        the Lord shall make to Himself a people from out of them that know
        Him not, even from the rovers of the sea; they that pull down His
        Church shall build it again, and they shall carry His name to many
        lands, for the sea shall be covered with their ships; and they shall
        rule over the nations from the one end of heaven to the
        other.”</span></p>

        life, and went her way to meet the future that lay before her.</p>

        long, desperate fight was over, and the great British champion had
        turned back for a time the tide of Saxon invasion. The heathen dead
        lay, rank by rank, as they had fallen, every man in his place, in the
        great wedge-like formation which had resisted all the efforts of the
        Britons during the first day of the struggle, and had been with
        difficulty broken through on the second.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The King was
        sitting amidst a circle of his knights on the top of the hill,
        resting from his toils. His cross-hilted sword stood fixed in the
        ground before him. On one side lay his helmet, bearing for its crest
        a dragon wrought in gold; on the other, his shield, on which was
        blazoned the figure of the Virgin.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A priest
        approached, walking in front of a party of four who were carrying a
        litter, and who, at a sign from their leader, set it down before the
        King.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        any of the wounded with my ministrations, when word was brought to me
        that a Saxon desired to talk with me. He could speak the British
        tongue, it was told me, a thing almost unheard of among these
        barbarians. I did not delay to visit the man, and finding that he
        desired above all things to speak to your lordship, I took it upon
        myself to order that he should be brought.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wounded man
        raised himself with some difficulty, and by the help of one of the
        bearers, into a sitting posture. He was of almost gigantic
        proportions, and though his hair and beard were white as snow, showed
        little of the waste and emaciation of age.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the King’s
        knights recognized him at once.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        rank, and stood close to a young chief, whose guardian he seemed to
        be. I observed that he was content to ward off blows that were aimed
        at the young man, but never dealt any himself. What came to him and
        his charge afterwards I do not know, for the tide of battle carried
        me away.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My lord King,”</span> said the old man, speaking British
        fluently, though with a foreign accent, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        knight speaks true. Neither to-day, nor yesterday, nor indeed through
        all the years during which my people have fought with yours, have I
        stained my hands with British blood. Indeed for forty years I have
        not set foot on this island. But this year I was constrained to come,
        for the young Prince of my people, Logrin by name, was with the army,
        and his father had given him into my charge, and I could not leave
        him. All day, therefore, I stood by him, and warded off the blows
        with such strength and skill as I had, and when his death hour came,
        for he fell on the morning of the second day, I cared no more for my
        own life. So much I say that you may listen to me the more willingly,
        though report says of you that you are generous, not to friends only,
        but also to foes. But I have something to say that is of more moment.
        Many years ago I was a prisoner in this land, having been taken by
        one of the ships of Count Ælius. Many things happened to me during my
        sojourn here of which it does not concern me to speak, except of
        this. There was in the household of the Count a maiden, his daughter
        by adoption, but of British birth, Carna by name. She was very
        anxious to bring me to faith in her Master, Christ; and I was no
        little moved by her words, and still <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>more by the example of her goodness. But I loved
        her, and this love seemed to hinder me, for how could I tell whether
        it were truth itself or the love that was persuading me? And would
        not he be the basest of men who for love of a woman should leave the
        faith of his fathers? So I remained, though it was half against my
        own mind, in my unbelief, and when she would not take me for her
        husband, being unbaptized, we parted, and I saw her no more. But her
        words, and the memory of her, have dwelt with me unceasingly, and now
        that God has brought me back to this land, I desire to have that
        which once I refused. But tell me, my lord King, have you any
        knowledge of this lady Carna?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said the King, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        know her well, and by the ordering of God, as I do not doubt, she is
        in this very place this day, for she gives her whole time to
        ministering to such as are in trouble or sorrow. She shall be sent
        for forthwith, and the archbishop also, who will, if he thinks fit,
        administer to you the holy rite of baptism.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cedric, for as my
        readers will have guessed it was he, bowed his head in assent, and
        after swallowing a cordial which the King’s physician put to his
        lips, sank back upon the litter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In about half an
        hour Carna appeared. She was dressed in the garb of a religious
        house, for she had taken the vows, and she was followed by a small
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310"
        id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>company of holy women who, like
        her, had devoted their lives to the service of their poor and
        suffering brothers and sisters in Christ. Time had dealt gently with
        her, as he often does with gentle souls. The glossy chestnut hair of
        the past was changed indeed to a silvery white, and her face was
        wasted with fast and vigil; but her complexion was clear and delicate
        as of old, and her eyes as lustrous and deep.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When she saw and
        recognized the wounded man—for she did recognize him at once—a sweet
        and tender smile came over her face. Her gift of intuition seemed to
        tell her that her prayers were answered, and that the soul for which
        her supplications had gone up day by day, from youth to age, had been
        given to her.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Carna,”</span> said the dying man, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“God has brought me back to you after many years, and
        before it is too late. Your God is my God, and your country my
        country—but not here. Once I could not own it, fearing lest my love

            West. In 394 Theodosius died, and the Empire was divided between
            his two sons, Honorius taking the West and Arcadius the East.
            Stilicho’s daughter Maria was now betrothed to Honorius, and his
            influence continued to increase. He restored peace to the Empire,
            conquering the Franks, chastising the Saxon pirates, and driving
            back, it is said, the Picts and Scots from Britain by the very
            terror of his name. For six years (398-404) he was engaged in a
            struggle with Alaric, King of the Goths, over whom he won, in the
            year 403, a great victory at Pollentia, near the modern Turin,
            and whom he defeated again in the following year under the walls
            of Verona. He is said to have conceived the idea of securing the
            Empire for his own son, and for this purpose to have entered into
            intrigues with his old enemy Alaric. However this may be, it is
            certain that he fell into disgrace. His end is related in this
            chapter. The poet Claudian employed himself in writing the
            praises of Stilicho and invectives against his rivals Rufinus and
            Eutropius.</dd>

              Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
              electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
              computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new
              computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of
              volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Volunteers
              and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
              they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s goals
              and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
              freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
              Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a
              secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
              generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
